## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1️⃣ Browse Available Pools

Navigate to the **Marketplace** and browse available coverage pools. Each pool is categorised by risk type:

| Category | What It Covers | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stablecoin Depeg** | Loss of peg for stablecoins | USDC, DAI, FRAX |
| **Vault Cover** | Smart contract exploits on yield vaults | Aave aUSDC, Compound cUSDC |
| **Ecosystem Risk** | Broader protocol events (parametric) | Bridge failures, oracle manipulation |

Each pool shows a **risk rating** (AAA to C), current premium rates, and available capacity.

### 2️⃣ Configure Your Policy

Select a pool and configure:

- **Coverage Amount** - How much protection you need (in USDC)
- **Duration** - Fixed-term protection, with duration options defined by each pool
- **Premium** - Automatically calculated based on the pool's fixed rate

The premium formula is straightforward:

$$P = \frac{\text{Coverage} \times \text{Rate (bps)} \times \text{Duration (days)}}{365 \times 10{,}000}$$

### Estimate Your Premium

<PremiumCalculator defaultCoverage={10000} defaultRate={500} defaultDuration={90} />

### 3️⃣ Approve & Purchase

The purchase is an atomic, two-step on-chain transaction:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant OrderBook
    participant IntentMatcher
    participant PolicyManager

    You->>OrderBook: Select best quote
    OrderBook->>IntentMatcher: Match buyer + underwriter intent
    IntentMatcher->>PolicyManager: Lock capital + mint policy
    PolicyManager-->>You: 🎫 Policy NFT minted to your wallet
```

1. **Approve** USDC spending for the premium amount
2. **Confirm** the purchase transaction
3. Your **Policy NFT** is minted directly to your wallet

### 4️⃣ Coverage Active

Your coverage is active immediately upon purchase.

<Callout type="warning">
  **7-Day Cooldown:** Claims cannot be filed for the first 7 days after purchase. This governance-defined waiting period prevents opportunistic purchases after an exploit has already begun. If an incident is reported before your purchase during this window, your cover for that event is void.
</Callout>

## Vault Cover: Additional Steps

If you're purchasing cover for **ERC-4626 vault shares** (e.g., Aave aUSDC, Compound cUSDC):

1. The protocol **snapshots your position's USDC value** at purchase time
2. You **retain full custody** of your vault shares and continue earning yield
3. When claiming, you transfer the shares and receive a payout at the snapshotted value

<details>
<summary>How is the snapshot value calculated?</summary>

The protocol reads the vault's `convertToAssets()` function at the block of purchase to determine the USDC-equivalent value of your shares. This becomes the maximum payout amount. If the vault appreciates after purchase, the extra yield is yours to keep - but the payout is capped at the snapshot.

</details>

## After Purchase

Once you have your Policy NFT:

- **View** your active policies on the dashboard
- **Transfer** the NFT to another wallet - the new holder can file claims
- **Cancel** early for a pro-rata refund of unused premium
- **Wait** for expiry - the NFT remains in your wallet but coverage lapses
