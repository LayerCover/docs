<Callout type="info">
  **TL;DR:** Your policy is an NFT. View it on the dashboard, transfer it to any wallet, cancel it for a pro-rata refund, or let it expire naturally.
</Callout>

## Viewing Your Policies

Your active policies are visible on the **Dashboard** at [app.layercover.com](https://app.layercover.com). Each policy shows:

- **Pool** - Which protocol or asset is covered
- **Coverage Amount** - Maximum payout in USDC
- **Duration** - Start date, end date, days remaining
- **Status** - Active, Expired, Claimed, or Cancelled
- **Policy ID** - On-chain identifier (also the NFT token ID)

---

## Transferring Policies

Policies are standard **ERC-721 NFTs**, which means they are fully transferable.

```

- Transfer via the LayerCover dashboard, or any NFT marketplace / wallet
- The **current holder** of the Policy NFT has the right to file claims
- Transfers do not change the policy terms, coverage amount, or expiry date

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Once you transfer a Policy NFT, you lose the ability to file claims or cancel the policy. Only the current holder has these rights.
</Callout>

## Cancelling a Policy

You can cancel any active policy before its expiry date and receive a **pro-rata refund** of unused premium.

**How the refund works:**

$$\text{Refund} = \text{Premium Paid} \times \frac{\text{Days Remaining}}{\text{Total Duration}}$$

<Callout type="info">
  **Example:** You paid \$123 for a 90-day policy and cancel after 30 days. You receive approximately **\$82 back** (60/90 of the premium).
</Callout>

**To cancel:**
1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Click on the active policy
3. Click **Cancel Policy**
4. Confirm the transaction - the refund is sent to your wallet immediately

<details>
<summary>What happens to the underwriter's capital?</summary>

When you cancel, the underwriter's locked capital is released immediately and becomes available for new policies. The portion of premium already earned (for the elapsed days) remains with the underwriter.

</details>

---

## Policy Expiry

When a policy reaches its end date:

- The policy **NFT remains in your wallet** but coverage lapses
- No further claims can be filed against expired policies
- The underwriter's capital lock is automatically released
- No action is required from you - expiry is passive

---

## Renewing a Policy

LayerCover does not currently offer automatic renewals. To maintain continuous coverage:

1. Purchase a new policy before your current one expires
2. The new policy has its own 7-day cooldown period
3. For uninterrupted coverage, purchase the new policy 7 days before the old one expires

<Callout type="info">
  **Tip:** Set a reminder 10 days before your policy expires to ensure you have time to purchase renewal coverage without a gap.
</Callout>
