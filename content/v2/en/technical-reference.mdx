In-depth documentation for the LayerCover protocol's smart contracts, systems, and architecture.

LayerCover is a decentralized insurance protocol that connects liquidity providers (Underwriters) with policyholders through a set of modular smart contracts. The system is designed to be solvent, transparent, and automated.



## Core Systems

### [Syndicate System](/technical-reference/syndicate-system)
The economic engine of LayerCover. Syndicates are vaults where Liquidity Providers (LPs) deposit capital.
*   **Capital Management:** Manages deposits, withdrawals, and capital allocation.
*   **Yield Strategies:** Idle capital can be deployed to yield-generating strategies.
*   **Risk Segmentation:** Different syndicates can underwrite different risk types.

### [Policy System](/technical-reference/policy-system)
Handles the lifecycle of insurance policies.
*   **Issuance:** Mints policies as NFTs to users.
*   **Modifications:** Allows for policy adjustments over time.
*   **premiums:** Collects premiums and routes them to the appropriate syndicates.

### [Payout System](/technical-reference/payout-system)
Manages the claim process and ensures valid claims are paid.
*   **Claims Assessment:** Verifies claim validity (via oracle or governance).
*   **Liquidity Waterfall:** Determines the order in which capital sources are tapped for payouts (Syndicate first, then Reinsurance).
*   **Loss Distribution:** Calculates how losses are distributed among LPs.

### [Reinsurance System](/technical-reference/reinsurance-system)
Provides a safety net for the protocol.
*   **Shared Backstop:** A pool of capital that sits behind individual syndicates.
*   **Catastrophe Protection:** Activated in extreme scenarios where syndicate capital is exhausted.
*   **Tranche Management:** Manages risk tranches for sophisticated underwriting.
