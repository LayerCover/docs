<Callout type="info">
  **TL;DR:** Syndicate Managers allocate LP capital across risk pools, post fixed-rate quotes on the orderbook, and earn performance fees on net profits.
</Callout>

This page is for **Syndicate Managers** - the operators who manage capital allocation on behalf of depositors. If you're an LP looking to deposit passively, see [Syndicates](/underwriters/syndicates).

| **Capital Allocation** | Distribute LP capital across selected pools |

## Allocation Strategy

### Pool Selection Criteria

When choosing pools for your syndicate:

1. **Risk rating** - Higher-rated pools (AAA/AA) offer less premium but lower claim risk
2. **Premium rates** - Compare the rate policyholders are paying vs your required return
3. **Utilisation** - Pools with high demand but low capacity offer pricing power
4. **Correlation** - Avoid concentrating on pools that share mutex groups
5. **Term profile** - Shorter terms (30d) give faster capital recycling

### Leverage Management

As the manager, you control the syndicate's leverage profile by choosing your allocation mix:

<Callout type="warning">
  **Capital efficiency vs safety.** Higher leverage means more premium income per dollar but increased exposure. Conservative syndicates typically run 2–3× leverage; aggressive ones push toward 5–8×.
</Callout>

## Fixed-Rate Market Making

Managers can post **sell-side intents** on the RFQ OrderBook - essentially committed quotes at specific rates.

**How it works:**

1. **Post intent** - Commit a specific amount at a specific rate (e.g., "$50K at 600bps for 90 days")
2. **Buyer matches** - A policyholder accepts your quote
3. **Policy minted** - Capital is locked immediately, premium is collected
4. **Capital returned** - At policy expiry (or claim), capital is released

**Why?** Market making lets managers set their own prices and guarantee execution. Instead of waiting for policies to be sold via the pool's AMM rate, you directly offer competitive quotes.

## Performance Fees

Managers earn a **performance fee** on net profits generated by the syndicate:

$$\text{Fee} = \text{Performance Fee \%} \times (\text{Premiums} + \text{Yield} - \text{Losses})$$

- Typical performance fees range from **10–20%**
- Fees are deducted at the vault level, so LP share prices already reflect fees
- No fee is charged on principal - only on profits

## Capacity Management

| Control | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deposit caps** | Set maximum TVL for the syndicate |
| **Per-LP limits** | Optionally cap individual deposit sizes |
| **Whitelist mode** | Restrict deposits to approved addresses |
| **Allocation limits** | Maximum percentage of syndicate capital per pool |
