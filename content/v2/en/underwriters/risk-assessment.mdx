<Callout type="info">
  **TL;DR:** Every pool has a risk rating (AAA–C) that determines its risk cost. Lower risk = more leverage capacity. Evaluate pools before allocating.
</Callout>

## Risk Ratings

Every risk pool is assigned a rating based on the protocol it covers, its audit history, TVL, and operational maturity.

| Rating | Risk Cost | Leverage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ AAA | 10 | 10× | Battle-tested protocols (Aave, Compound). Multiple audits, years of operation, high TVL |
| ✅ AA | 20 | 5× | Well-established protocols with strong track records |
| ⚠️ A | 30 | 3.3× | Solid protocols with some operational history |
| ⚠️ BBB | 50 | 2× | Mid-tier protocols, newer or less audited |
| 🚨 BB | 70 | 1.4× | Higher risk, limited audit coverage |
| 🚨 B | 85 | 1.2× | Elevated risk, emerging protocols |
| 🚨 C | 100 | 1× | Maximum risk, no leverage permitted |

## Evaluating a Pool

Before allocating capital, assess these dimensions:

### 1. Protocol Security

- **Audit count** - How many independent audits has the covered protocol completed?
- **Bug bounty** - Is there an active bug bounty program?
- **Incident history** - Has the protocol been exploited before?
- **Code maturity** - How long has the code been deployed without changes?

### 2. Pool Economics

- **Premium rate** - What APR are policyholders paying?
- **Utilisation** - What percentage of the pool's capacity is currently backing active policies?
- **Term distribution** - Are policies short-term (30d) or long-term (90d)?

### 3. Correlation Risk

- **Mutex groups** - Is this pool correlated with other pools you're already backing?
- **Asset correlation** - Does the covered asset share smart contract risk with your other allocations?

<Callout type="warning">
  **Watch for correlation.** Backing three pools that all cover Aave products looks diversified but is essentially concentrated on a single smart contract risk. Check mutex groups before allocating.

## Risk Points Budget

Your risk points budget (default: 100) limits total exposure. Each allocation consumes points proportional to the pool's risk cost and your allocation size:

$$\text{Points Used} = \text{Risk Cost} \times \frac{\text{Allocation Amount}}{\text{Total Deposit}}$$

### Budget Optimisation Strategy

| Strategy | Pool Mix | Total Leverage | Risk Profile |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative** | All AAA/AA pools | 5–10× | Low premium, low risk |
| **Balanced** | Mix of AAA, A, BBB | 2–4× | Moderate premium, moderate risk |
| **Aggressive** | Heavy BBB/BB allocation | 1–2× | High premium, high risk |

## Monitoring Active Allocations

After allocating, continue monitoring:

- **Incident reports** - Are any of your pools under investigation?
- **Premium inflow** - Are policies being purchased against your pools?
- **Risk rating changes** - Has the protocol been re-rated?
- **Capacity utilisation** - Is the pool nearing capacity limits?
