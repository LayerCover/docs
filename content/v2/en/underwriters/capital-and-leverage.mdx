  **TL;DR:** Deposit single-sided liquidity, allocate across uncorrelated pools for leverage, and manage exposure with a risk points budget.
</Callout>

## Single-Sided Liquidity

Underwriters participate by depositing a single asset (e.g., USDC) into the **CapitalPool**. There's no LP pairing, no governance token requirement, and no impermanent loss.

- **Asset choice** - Deposit USDC (or wstETH on the LST instance)
- **External yield** - Idle capital (not backing active claims) earns DeFi yield via whitelisted adapters (Aave, Compound)
- **Full withdrawal** - Get back your principal + earned premiums + yield, minus any claim losses

## Capital Pledges

When you allocate capital to a pool, you create a **pledge** - a commitment to back policies sold from that pool.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    D["Your $100K Deposit"] --> PA["Pool A<br/>$35K pledge"]
    D --> PB["Pool B<br/>$35K pledge"]
    D --> PC["Pool C<br/>$30K pledge"]
    D --> PD["Pool D<br/>$20K pledge"]
    PA --> P1["Premium income"]
    PB --> P2["Premium income"]
    PC --> P3["Premium income"]
    PD --> P4["Premium income"]
```

- Total pledges ($120K) can **exceed your deposit** — this is leverage
- Each pledge is capped at **35% of your principal** (see [Per-Pool Concentration Limit](#per-pool-concentration-limit))
- Your capital can be pledged across **multiple pools simultaneously**
- Pledges can be adjusted as pools change or as you rebalance

---

## Risk Points & Leverage

The protocol uses **risk points** to control leverage - the ability to back more total coverage than your deposit.

### How Risk Points Work

Each pool is assigned a **risk cost** (0–100) based on its risk rating. When you allocate to a pool, it consumes risk points from your total budget.

| Risk Rating | Risk Cost | Max Leverage (single pool) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ AAA | 10 | 10× |
| ✅ AA  | 20 | 5× |
| ⚠️ A   | 30 | 3.3× |
| ⚠️ BBB | 50 | 2× |
| 🚨 BB  | 70 | 1.4× |
| 🚨 B/C | 100 | 1× (no leverage) |

**Default risk points budget: 100**

### Worked Example

You deposit **100,000 USDC** and have 100 risk points to spend. Each pool pledge is capped at **35%** of principal (35K on 100K):

| Allocation | Pool Rating | Risk Cost | Points Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $35K → Aave USDC | AAA (10) | 10 × (35/100) = 3.5 | 3.5 |
| $35K → Compound cDAI | AA (20) | 20 × (35/100) = 7 | 7 |
| $30K → DeFi Vault X | A (30) | 30 × (30/100) = 9 | 9 |
| $20K → Yield Farm Y | BBB (50) | 50 × (20/100) = 10 | 10 |
| **$120K total coverage** | | | **29.5 / 100 used** |

You're backing **120K** in coverage with only **100K** in capital — that's **1.2× leverage**, spread across four pools with no single pool exceeding the 35% concentration limit. You still have 70.5 risk points remaining for more allocations.

### Try It Yourself

<RiskPointsCalculator defaultDeposit={100000} maxBudget={100} />

<Callout type="warning">
  **Leverage means correlated risk matters.** If two pools cover the same protocol and both pay claims simultaneously, your capital could be insufficient. That's why the protocol limits leverage via risk points and uses **mutex groups** to flag correlated pools.
</Callout>

---

## Mutex Groups

Pools that cover correlated risks are grouped into **mutex (mutual exclusion) groups**. When multiple pools in the same mutex group are allocated together, their risk costs compound.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    M["Mutex Group: 'Aave'"] --> P1["Aave USDC Pool"]
    M --> P2["Aave DAI Pool"]
    M --> P3["Aave wETH Pool"]
```

If an Aave exploit occurs, all three pools could pay claims simultaneously. The protocol accounts for this by requiring higher effective risk budgets for correlated allocations.

---

## Per-Pool Concentration Limit

To prevent over-concentration of risk, the protocol enforces a **35% per-pool exposure cap**. No single pool can receive more than 35% of a syndicate's deposited principal, regardless of available risk points.

### How It Works

When allocating capital, the protocol calculates the maximum pledge per pool:

```
maxPledgePerPool = principal × 35%
```

Any allocation that would push a pool's pledge above this threshold is rejected.

### Worked Example

You deposit **$100,000**. The per-pool cap is 35%:

| Pool | Pledge | Cap ($35K) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Aave USDC | $35,000 | $35,000 | ✅ At limit |
| Compound cDAI | $30,000 | $35,000 | ✅ Under limit |
| DeFi Vault X | $25,000 | $35,000 | ✅ Under limit |
| **Aave USDC +$5K** | **$40,000** | **$35,000** | **❌ Rejected** |

Even though you have unused risk points, the fourth allocation is rejected because it would push Pool A above 35% of your $100K principal.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P["$100K Principal"] --> C["35% Cap = $35K per pool"]
    C --> PA["Pool A: $35K ✅"]
    C --> PB["Pool B: $30K ✅"]
    C --> PC["Pool C: $25K ✅"]
    C -.-> PD["Pool A +$5K ❌"]
    style PD fill:#ef444420,stroke:#ef4444
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Lloyd's alignment.** This 35% cap mirrors traditional insurance concentration limits. Lloyd's of London restricts syndicates from allocating more than a set percentage of capacity to any single risk class, preventing catastrophic losses from a single correlated event.
</Callout>

### Captive Syndicate Overrides

Governance can grant specific syndicates a **per-syndicate exposure override** for higher concentration. This is designed for **captive syndicates** — dedicated vaults that back a single protocol.

- A **100% override** allows the syndicate to pledge its entire principal to one pool
- A **50% override** allows up to half of principal per pool
- Setting the override to **0** reverts to the global 35% default

When an override is active, the maximum number of pool allocations is also dynamically capped to prevent leverage amplification (e.g., 100% override → max 1 pool).

---

## Capital Adequacy Ratio

Syndicates must maintain a minimum **50% capital adequacy ratio** to write new business. This means the syndicate's principal must be at least 50% of its total pledged exposure.

If losses erode a syndicate's principal below this threshold, the protocol blocks new intent reservations (quoting) until the ratio recovers — either through new deposits or pledge reductions.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Solvency gating.** This mirrors Lloyd's Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). Syndicates below the threshold can still manage existing policies and process claims, but cannot take on new risk until recapitalized.
</Callout>

## Premium Distribution

When policyholders pay premiums, the premium is split:

```mermaid
pie title Premium Distribution
    "Underwriter Share" : 85
    "Backstop Pool" : 10
    "Protocol Fee" : 5
```

- **85%** goes to underwriters (proportional to capital pledged to the pool)
- **10%** goes to the Backstop Pool (protocol-wide reinsurance)
- **5%** goes to the protocol treasury
