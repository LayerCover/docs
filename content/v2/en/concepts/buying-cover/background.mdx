## Policyholder Benefits

LayerCover is designed to solve the structural limitations of traditional on-chain insurance. The protocol provides guaranteed, predictable coverage through fixed rate policies with distinct advantages over mutual-based models.

### Fixed Rate Cover

For users who require stability and predictability, LayerCover's fixed rate model provides guaranteed pricing.

* **Budget Certainty:** You lock in a guaranteed price for the entire duration of your policy. You know exactly what your coverage will cost upfront, with zero risk of premiums spiking due to market volatility.
* **Guaranteed Capacity:** When you purchase fixed cover, the capital backing your policy is specifically reserved for you. It cannot be crowded out by other users or drained by other claims, ensuring the funds are there specifically for your expiration date.
* **Zero Slippage:** This is ideal for large institutional positions where cost predictability is essential.

### Instant, Rules-Based Settlement

This feature removes the "human element" that causes delays and uncertainty in other coverage models.

* **Certainty of Payout:** Claims are not subject to community votes, committee debates, or political swaying. If the on-chain conditions are met, the payout is guaranteed.
* **Immediate Liquidity:** In the event of a loss, you receive funds instantly. This is critical in DeFi, where waiting weeks for a governance vote could mean missing opportunities to recover or re-deploy capital.

### Protocol-Native Reinsurance Protection

This acts as a failsafe, providing a second layer of security behind the primary liquidity pools.

* **Deep Solvency:** It ensures that even during catastrophic market events where many users claim at once, there is a dedicated reserve of backup capital available to settle your claim.
* **Reduced Counterparty Risk:** You don't have to worry about the primary pool running dry; the protocol is structured to ensure funds are available when you need them most.
