The Fixed Rate model, using **Intent-Based Pricing**, is an RFQ (Request for Quote) style marketplace designed for institutional hedgers, market makers, and users requiring budget certainty. Fixed Rate policies have a set duration and a deterministic, upfront premium cost. This model is ideal when you need to lock in a specific rate for a defined period without risk of premium fluctuation.


## How Fixed Rate Cover Works

Fixed Rate cover leans on the [Intent-Based Pricing](/concepts/pricing/intent-based) rails. Professional syndicates publish binding quotes (coverage, APR, duration) that you can execute instantly.

- **Fixed Term & Cost:** Pick a duration (e.g., 30/60/90 days). The quoted APR is deterministic for that term.
- **Upfront Premium:** You prepay the full premium at execution. No streaming or top-ups.
- **Capital Locking:** The matched syndicate’s capital is atomically reserved for your policy duration, guaranteeing capacity.
- **Policy NFT:** You still receive an NFT encoding coverage, expiration, and claim rights.

## Step-by-Step Buying Guide

### 1. Request for Quote (RFQ)
The system aggregates binding offers (called "Intents") posted off-chain by Syndicate Managers. These Intents specify a rate, an amount, and a duration they are willing to underwrite.

### 2. Configure and Select an Intent
You define your required coverage:
- **Coverage Amount:** The amount of capital you wish to insure.
- **Coverage Duration:** The fixed length of time you require protection (e.g., 60 days).

The platform will present you with the best available quotes that match your duration.

### 3. Review Cost and Finalize
The premium schedule is deterministic (see the [pricing guide](/concepts/pricing/intent-based#premium-formula)). Review the quote, confirm the counterparty, and proceed when you’re satisfied.

The orderbook interface lists the best Syndicate quotes for your selected duration, letting you compare amount, APR, and expiry windows at a glance.

### 4. Atomic Policy Issuance
Upon confirmation, a single transaction executes the following steps:
1.  Your upfront premium is transferred.
2.  The matched underwriter's capital is locked for the policy duration.
3.  Your Policy NFT is minted, and coverage becomes active.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
I**mportant:** Coverage is active instantly upon purchase. However, **claims cannot be made for the first 7 days**. This governance-defined waiting period prevents opportunistic purchases immediately after an exploit has already begun. If an incident is reported before you purchased cover during this 7-day period, your cover for that event is void.
</Callout>

### 4. Vault Cover (ERC-4626 Only)

If you are purchasing cover for yield-bearing vault shares (ERC-4626): The protocol records a snapshot of your position's USDC value at purchase time. You retain full custody of your vault shares in your own wallet and continue earning yield. When claiming, you transfer the shares and receive an instant payout at the snapshotted value. Review the [vault claim flow](/concepts/buying-cover/claims-payouts#model-b-vault-cover-erc-4626-vaults) for details.


## Policy Management and Expiration

### Policy Adjustments
- **Increases/Reductions:** Fixed Rate policies are for a set amount and term. You cannot increase or reduce the coverage amount after purchase. If you require more coverage, you must purchase a new policy.
- **Cancellation:** You may choose to voluntarily cancel a Fixed Rate policy before expiration. You will receive a refund of the unused premium proportional to the remaining time on the contract.

### Expiration
Once the fixed duration is reached, the policy expires automatically. The underwriter's locked capital is released, and your Policy NFT becomes inert.
