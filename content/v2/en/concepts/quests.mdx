# Quests: Proof of Participation

LayerCover is built on the belief that ownership should be earned, not just given. Instead of a traditional specialized airdrop where tokens are distributed freely (often to mercenary capital), we use a **Quest System** to identify and reward true community members who actively contribute to the protocol's health.

<Callout type="info">
  **Core Philosophy:** We do not do "pure airdrops." To earn ownership and rewards, you must have "skin in the game" through verifying active participation.
</Callout>

## Why No Airdrop?

Standard airdrops often fail to align incentives. They can attract sybil attackers and short-term speculators who dump tokens immediately, harming the long-term value for committed stakeholders.

By requiring **buy-in** and verifiable actions, we ensure that:
1.  **Alignment**: Rewards go to users who actually use and understand the platform.
2.  **Sustainability**: Capital comes from committed participants, not just yield farmers.
3.  **Fairness**: Active contributors get access to early-stage growth opportunities usually reserved for VCs.

## The Quest Dashboard

The primary hub for your activity is the **Quest Dashboard**. Here, you complete specific on-chain and off-chain actions to earn **Quest Points**.

### Available Quests

Completing these tasks proves your utility to the network:

1.  **Mint Testnet Tokens**: Your onboarding step. Get the resources needed to interact with the protocol risk-free.
2.  **Supply Liquidity**: Become an underwriter. Deposit capital into syndicates to back coverage and earn yield. This is the lifeblood of the insurance protocol.
3.  **Backstop Provider**: Deposit into the **[CAT Pool](/concepts/reinsurance)**. This deeper layer of protection secures the protocol against catastrophic events.
4.  **Purchase Cover**: Protect your own assets. Using the product for its intended purpose is the ultimate proof of belief.
5.  **Make a Claim**: Experience the "moment of truth." Successfully filing a valid claim demonstrates the system's reliability.
6.  **Social Verification**: Share your progress on X (Twitter). Helps grow the community organically.

## Rewards: Seed Round Valuation

The ultimate reward for completing your quests is not just free tokens, but **opportunity**.

By accruing Quest Points, you unlock the ability to invest in LayerCover governance tokens at **Seed Round Valuation**. This gives community members the same favorable entry price as early institutional investors, democratizing access to the project's potential upside.
