LayerCover separates token ownership from day-to-day governance by letting COVR holders delegate their votes through staking contracts. Instead of expecting every token holder to attend each vote, the protocol routes influence through specialized delegates who watch proposals closely. Staking converts liquid COVR into vote weight, pins it behind the appropriate cool-down timers, and records who can vote on behalf of that balance. The process is designed so that anyone can participate without running infrastructure while still keeping full control over when they can exit.

## Choosing a Staking Path

There are two ways to supply voting power. `Staking.sol` caters to professional delegates and councils. It accepts deposits that can be split across up to ten managers at once, so you can allocate part of your stake to a risk specialist, another part to an operations-focused team, and so on. `PlatformStaking.sol` is the lighter option for token holders who want to manage a single delegate or vote themselves. Both contracts expose the same staking interface—connect your wallet, enter the amount of COVR to stake, and approve the contract to spend your tokens—but they differ in how much control you retain over multiple delegates and which incentive streams you tap into. You can move between them by unstaking from one, waiting through the unlock window, and restaking in the other when the funds are free.

## Delegating and Rebalancing

After staking you pick the delegate address that should carry your votes. On the multi-delegation contract this happens per slice of your stake: you choose a manager, enter the amount you want them to control, and sign a delegation transaction. The contract updates its internal ledger immediately, so proposals that snapshot after the transaction recognize the new vote weight. Changing your mind later is just as direct—you submit a new delegation for the revised amount, and the contract shifts voting power without forcing you to unstake. Delegates can also opt to charge a fee (capped on-chain) that is skimmed from the rewards their supporters earn, so you always see the net rate before committing.

## Voting Locks and Withdrawals

The staking contracts purposely slow down exits to prevent “vote then rug” scenarios. Simply staking applies a rolling seven-day unlock timer; the countdown resets whenever you cast a vote, sign a delegation change, or claim rewards. When you decide to leave, you start an unstake request that burns your staking receipt tokens and begins the waiting period. After the timer expires you can withdraw the original COVR plus any unclaimed rewards. Attempting to exit early will revert, so plan around the lock if you know a proposal is coming up. This design keeps voting power stable between proposal creation and execution, and it stops large token holders from swinging votes without leaving any skin in the game.

## Rewards and Ongoing Maintenance

Both staking contracts distribute protocol incentives automatically. Governance payments arrive in COVR, and some delegates sweeten their slice with additional ERC-20 tokens to attract supporters. Rewards accrue block by block through a rewards-per-share formula, so every deposit or withdrawal first settles your pending amount before updating balances. Claiming rewards does not require unstaking, but it does reset the seven-day lock because the action proves you were recently active. Periodically review which delegates you support: if a delegate goes inactive or starts voting against your interests, you can redirect your voting weight with a single transaction while leaving your stake untouched. Staying engaged in this way keeps voting power aligned with the most responsive representatives and ensures the protocol’s decisions always reflect informed oversight.
