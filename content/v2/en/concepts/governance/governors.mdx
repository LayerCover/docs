## Role of Governors

Governors are the delegates who accept voting power from COVR holders and turn it into real governance outcomes. When you delegate, you are essentially hiring a specialist to monitor proposals, interpret their impact, and vote in your best interests without forcing you to camp the forums every day. The delegate holds no custody over your tokens—they only receive temporary voting rights while your stake stays inside the protocol’s staking contracts. That arrangement keeps custody risk low while ensuring there is always someone awake to respond when risk parameters change or an emergency pause needs review.

## Selecting a Governor

From a user perspective the process starts with research. Each governor publishes a profile detailing their focus areas, voting philosophy, and any fees they charge. You pick the delegate who aligns with your strategy, stake COVR through the appropriate contract, and point your voting weight at their address. The staking contract confirms the delegation immediately, so any proposal created after that block snapshots your votes under the governor’s control. You can shift your delegation later with a single transaction, so you retain full agency if performance slips or priorities change.

## Operating Cadence

Governors treat those votes as operating capital. They watch the timelock queue, risk dashboards, and forum discussions, then draft rationales for how they intend to vote. Before each vote they publish a quick summary explaining their decision, cite the metrics or simulations they leaned on, and flag any trade-offs users should know about. During volatile periods they may hold office hours or Twitter Spaces so delegators can ask questions directly. After voting they log the on-chain transaction hash in their public tracker so anyone can verify how they exercised the authority that was delegated to them.

## Accountability Channels

Accountability flows through a mix of performance history and economic incentives. Because staking contracts enforce a seven-day lock after each action, governors cannot borrow voting power for a day and disappear; they commit their own stake and keep it locked alongside their supporters. Many also post a personal bond or keep a portion of their rewards at risk, signalling they stand behind their decisions. Delegators can always reassign their stake, so a governor who misses proposals, votes without communicating, or ignores risk signals quickly loses voting weight. Conversely, consistent transparency, prompt participation, and accurate threat assessments attract more delegation and raise their influence.

## Bonds, Slashing, and Rewards

Escalating a suspected incident shows how the slashing mechanics keep governors honest. To pause a pool, a governor submits a proposal through the Committee contract and transfers a bond of roughly 1,000–2,500 COVR (scaled by token decimals). Those funds sit in escrow until the pause is resolved. If the vote fails, `_handleDefeatedProposal` immediately slashes `slashPercentageBps` of the bond and refunds the remainder, recording on-chain that the alert was inaccurate. If the pause passes, the bond remains locked until someone calls `resolvePauseBond` after the challenge window. At that point the protocol checks fees collected while the pool was paused: generating enough revenue unlocks the bond plus a 10–25% bonus, while falling short means the bond is seized entirely. Because the rules are public and deterministic, governors only raise alarms when they firmly believe the risk warrants a pause.

The same slashing logic protects day-to-day voting. Vote snapshots permanently tie a governor’s decision to the stake that backed it, and the seven-day cool-down means they cannot escape consequences before slashing or fee redistribution occurs. Rewards follow the same accounting path: before a slashed bond is redistributed to successful voters, the staking contracts ensure everyone who supported the winning side is still locked. That way, delegates who spam proposals or free-ride on other voters lose capital, while governors who do the work and call incidents accurately receive both reputation and ETH payouts.

## Tools and Coordination

Effective governors cultivate redundancies and tooling. They subscribe to governance bots that ping them when new actions enter the timelock, maintain dashboards that track pool utilization and CAT ratios, and rehearse emergency playbooks with the Guardian so they know who executes what if a pause is required. They also coordinate with other governors to avoid blind spots: one may specialize in underwriting math while another focuses on smart-contract upgrades, and together they trade notes so proposals get multi-angle reviews before votes close. As a delegator, you benefit from this collective expertise without needing to master every subsystem yourself.

## Becoming a Governor

If you decide to become a governor, the onboarding path mirrors what you would expect from a professional delegate network. You stake your own COVR to prove commitment, publish a manifesto explaining your perspective, set up secure wallets for voting and reward collection, and announce a fee structure if you plan to take a share of supporter rewards. Then you start voting consistently, documenting every decision, and communicating with the community. Trust accumulates over time; the more predictable your process and reporting, the more comfortable delegators feel directing their voting weight toward you.
