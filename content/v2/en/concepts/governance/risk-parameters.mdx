LayerCover's governance adjusts various protocol settings to maintain a careful balance between safety, capital efficiency, and user experience. Understanding these parameters helps both underwriters and policyholders make informed decisions about their participation in the protocol.

## Capital Pool Parameters

### Underwriter Withdrawal Notice Period

When underwriters decide to withdraw their capital from LayerCover, they don't receive their funds immediately. Instead, they must wait through a notice period, currently set at 7 days. This waiting period serves a critical function: it ensures the protocol has predictable liquidity to pay claims and prevents sudden mass withdrawals that could leave policyholders without coverage.

The notice period creates a natural trade-off. Longer waiting periods provide more stability and protection for the protocol and its users, but they require underwriters to plan their exits in advance and can feel restrictive if they need access to capital quickly. Shorter periods offer underwriters greater flexibility and faster access to their funds, but they increase the risk of capital flight during market stress when the protocol most needs stable liquidity.

Governance can adjust this parameter anywhere from 0 to 365 days, though dramatic changes are rare. The current 7-day setting represents a middle ground that provides reasonable stability while not overly restricting underwriter liquidity.

### System Operating Mode

LayerCover operates in different modes depending on market conditions and protocol health. Think of these modes as safety settings that determine what actions are allowed at any given time. The protocol typically runs in Normal Mode, where all features work as designed and users have full access to deposits, withdrawals, and all other operations.

When concerning events occur—such as unusual market volatility or potential security issues in integrated protocols—the Guardian may activate Guarded Mode. In this state, the protocol applies extra scrutiny to new high-risk operations while allowing existing positions to continue functioning normally. Users can still exit their positions if they choose, but the protocol exercises more caution about accepting new risk.

During critical situations like major security breaches or catastrophic market failures, Emergency Mode provides maximum protection. When activated, new deposits are temporarily disabled and the protocol blocks interactions with potentially compromised yield platforms. Users can only make emergency withdrawals using immediately available funds, ensuring no one's assets are sent to failing systems.

The table below summarizes these three operating modes:

| Mode | When Used | What's Allowed | What's Restricted |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Normal** | Regular operations | All deposits, withdrawals, and features | Nothing |
| **Guarded** | Elevated risk conditions | Existing positions, emergency exits | New high-risk operations |
| **Emergency** | Critical failures | Emergency withdrawals (idle funds only) | New deposits, yield platform interactions |

The Guardian can activate Emergency or Guarded Mode immediately when needed to protect users. However, returning to Normal Mode requires a 6-hour cooling-off period and governance approval, ensuring the underlying issues have been resolved before resuming full operations.

### Yield Protocols

Underwriter capital doesn't sit idle in LayerCover—it's deployed to established DeFi lending platforms like Aave, Compound, and Morpho to generate yield. Which platforms can hold this capital is a critical governance decision that affects both returns and risk exposure.

Governance maintains a curated list of approved yield platforms, with a maximum of 10 active at any time. Adding a new platform requires a 7-day approval process, giving the community time to review the integration and assess risks. This measured approach prevents hasty decisions while still allowing the protocol to adapt to new opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem.

When a platform needs to be removed, the process depends on the circumstances. If a platform simply isn't being used anymore, it can be deactivated once all funds have been withdrawn. However, if a platform experiences a security issue or operational problem, the Guardian has the authority to immediately mark it as "failed." This emergency action prevents new deposits and withdrawals from the affected platform, protecting user funds from being sent into a potentially compromised system. Once the platform resolves its issues, it can be restored to active status.

The number of active yield platforms represents an important balance. More platforms provide diversification—if one platform fails, only a fraction of the capital is at risk—and can potentially increase overall yields through optimization. However, each additional platform adds complexity to the system and creates more potential failure points to monitor. Fewer platforms simplify operations and reduce attack surface, but concentrate risk and may limit yield optimization opportunities.

## Risk Management Parameters

### CAT Pool Protection Levels

The CAT Pool serves as LayerCover's emergency backup fund, stepping in to help cover claims when a pool's capital becomes dangerously depleted. Rather than waiting until disaster strikes, the protocol uses a tiered intervention system that provides increasing levels of support as conditions worsen.

Each pool has two protection tiers configured by governance. Tier 1 typically activates when a pool's capital drops to around 80% of its healthy target level. At this point, the CAT Pool begins covering 20-30% of claims, providing early support while conserving most of the backup funds for potentially worse scenarios. This early intervention helps stabilize the situation before it becomes critical.

If conditions continue to deteriorate and capital falls to around 50% of the target level, Tier 2 activates. In this severe stress scenario, the CAT Pool takes on a much larger role, covering 50-70% of claims. This substantial support helps prevent a complete capital depletion while giving the pool time to recover or wind down orderly.

| Tier | Typical Trigger | CAT Pool Coverage | Purpose |
|------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | ~80% of target capital | 20-30% of claims | Early support, preserve backup funds |
| **Tier 2** | ~50% of target capital | 50-70% of claims | Substantial support during crisis |

Consider a practical example: The Aave pool has a $10M target capital level. When its capital drops to $8M (80%), Tier 1 activates and the CAT Pool starts covering 30% of each claim. If the situation worsens and capital falls to $5M (50%), Tier 2 kicks in and the CAT Pool increases its coverage to 60% of each claim.

These thresholds and coverage percentages involve important trade-offs. Setting triggers at higher capital levels (earlier intervention) provides more protection for underwriters and can prevent situations from spiraling out of control, but it also depletes the CAT Pool more quickly, potentially leaving less available for true catastrophes. Lower triggers preserve the CAT Pool for only the most severe situations but mean underwriters must absorb more losses before help arrives.

Similarly, higher coverage percentages reduce the risk borne by individual underwriters but accelerate CAT Pool depletion, while lower percentages keep the CAT Pool strong but expose underwriters to greater losses. Governance must carefully balance these considerations for each pool based on its risk profile and importance to the protocol.

### Coverage Limits

Every pool has a maximum amount of coverage it can sell, set by governance based on the pool's risk profile and available capital. These limits serve as a ceiling on the protocol's exposure to any single pool or protocol.

Higher coverage limits allow the protocol to serve more policyholders and generate more premium income, supporting faster growth. However, they also increase the potential magnitude of losses if a covered protocol experiences a major incident. Lower limits provide natural risk management by capping maximum exposure, but they restrict how much coverage users can purchase and slow the protocol's growth trajectory.

Governance typically sets these limits conservatively at launch and gradually increases them as pools build track records and demonstrate stability. The limits can be quickly reduced if conditions change or new risks emerge.

## Premium & Fee Parameters

### Premium Rate Curves

Premium pricing in LayerCover isn't static—it responds dynamically to supply and demand through rate curves. These curves determine how premiums change as a pool's utilization increases. When a pool has abundant available capital and low utilization, premiums remain relatively affordable. As more policyholders purchase coverage and utilization rises, premiums increase to signal underwriters that more capital is needed.

The steepness of these curves matters significantly. Steeper curves cause premiums to rise rapidly with utilization, creating strong price signals that help the protocol quickly find equilibrium between supply and demand. This responsiveness helps maintain proper capitalization but can make pricing less predictable for policyholders, especially during periods of high demand.

Flatter curves provide more pricing stability, making it easier for users to budget for coverage and understand costs over time. However, this stability comes at the expense of responsiveness—the protocol adjusts more slowly to imbalances between capital supply and coverage demand, potentially allowing unsustainable situations to persist longer.

### Claim Processing Fees

LayerCover charges a small fee on claim payouts, typically between 1-2% but adjustable up to 5%. This fee supports ongoing protocol operations, development, security audits, and improvements. When a policyholder receives a $100,000 claim payout, for example, a 2% fee means they receive $98,000 while $2,000 goes to the protocol treasury.

This parameter requires balancing two important considerations. Higher fees provide more sustainable funding for the protocol's long-term development and maintenance, ensuring it can continue improving and adapting. However, they also reduce the net benefit policyholders receive when filing claims. Lower fees maximize value for policyholders but may constrain the protocol's ability to fund necessary improvements and security measures.

The table below shows how different fee levels affect a $100,000 claim:

| Fee Rate | Policyholder Receives | Protocol Receives | Use Case |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1% | $99,000 | $1,000 | Minimal protocol overhead |
| 2% | $98,000 | $2,000 | Current typical setting |
| 5% | $95,000 | $5,000 | Maximum allowed fee |

## CAT Pool (Backstop) Parameters

### Withdrawal Waiting Periods

The CAT Pool functions as emergency backup capital, which means it needs to maintain reliable liquidity to fulfill its role. Like underwriter withdrawals, CAT Pool depositors face a waiting period between requesting their funds and receiving them. This period typically ranges from 7 to 14 days, ensuring the protocol can plan for outflows and maintain sufficient backup capital.

Longer waiting periods provide the CAT Pool with more predictable liquidity, making it easier to maintain the reserves needed to step in during pool stress events. However, they also make CAT Pool deposits less liquid for their holders, who must plan further ahead if they want to exit their positions. Shorter periods offer faster access to funds but increase the risk that large, sudden withdrawals could deplete the backup capital just when it's needed most.

### Risk Tranches

The CAT Pool employs a sophisticated tranche structure that divides the fund into junior, mezzanine, and senior tiers. This structure works like floors in a building—each tier provides a buffer that must be exhausted before losses reach the tier above.

Junior tranches sit on the bottom floor, bearing the first losses when the CAT Pool is tapped to support stressed pools. Because they take on this elevated risk, junior tranches earn significantly higher returns. Mezzanine tranches occupy the middle position, only absorbing losses after junior tranches are depleted, and earn moderate returns reflecting their intermediate risk level. Senior tranches sit at the top, only exposed after both lower tiers are exhausted, and earn the lowest returns in exchange for this enhanced protection.

This tranched structure serves multiple purposes. It allows CAT Pool depositors to select their preferred risk/reward profile rather than forcing everyone into the same position. It also creates a buffer system where losses must breach multiple layers before threatening the full backstop, improving the protocol's overall resilience.

| Tranche | Loss Priority | Return Level | Risk Profile |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Junior** | First to absorb losses | Highest returns | Higher risk, first line of defense |
| **Mezzanine** | Second to absorb losses | Moderate returns | Medium risk, secondary protection |
| **Senior** | Last to absorb losses | Lower returns | Lower risk, final safety layer |

## How Parameters Are Changed

Parameter changes follow a deliberate process designed to balance the need for adaptation with the importance of giving users time to respond. Understanding this process helps you anticipate changes and adjust your positions accordingly.

The process begins when governance identifies a need for adjustment. This might come from monitoring system performance metrics that show imbalances, observing changing market conditions, responding to community feedback, or addressing newly discovered security considerations. Once the need is established, governance formulates a specific proposed change with clear rationale.

The proposal then enters a public review period lasting 3 to 7 days, depending on the significance of the change. During this window, the entire community can examine the proposal and its expected effects. Users can discuss the change in governance forums, assess how it might impact their positions, and decide whether to adjust their strategy or voice concerns. This transparency gives everyone a fair opportunity to respond before changes take effect.

After the review period concludes, the change is implemented in the protocol. But governance's work doesn't end there—the team continues monitoring affected metrics to verify the change achieves its intended goals. If the results differ from expectations, governance can make further adjustments based on the observed outcomes.

It's important to note that emergency changes follow a different path. When the Guardian needs to activate Emergency Mode or mark a yield platform as failed to protect user funds, these actions can happen immediately without a review period. The urgency of genuine emergencies justifies this exception, though the community still reviews these actions afterward to ensure they were appropriate.

## How Parameters Work Together

Protocol parameters don't exist in isolation—they interact with each other in important ways. Governance must consider these relationships when making adjustments to ensure changes work harmoniously across the system.

Consider the relationship between CAT Pool triggers and reference capital. When governance sets CAT Pool intervention triggers at 80% and 50%, these percentages apply to a pool's reference capital—the target healthy capital level. If a pool's reference capital changes from $10M to $20M, the trigger percentages remain the same, but they now activate at different absolute amounts: $16M and $10M instead of $8M and $5M. This means a change to reference capital effectively shifts when the CAT Pool steps in, even without touching the trigger percentages themselves. Consequently, when governance significantly adjusts a pool's target capital, they must also review whether the existing trigger levels still make sense for the new scale.

Withdrawal periods and coverage limits also work in tandem. Longer withdrawal waiting periods make capital more predictable and stable, creating conditions that can safely support higher coverage limits. The protocol knows that capital won't suddenly vanish, so it can confidently sell more coverage. Conversely, shorter withdrawal periods mean less predictable liquidity, requiring more conservative coverage limits to ensure the protocol can always honor its commitments. Governance typically considers both parameters together when reassessing a pool's risk profile.

The relationship between yield platforms and safety procedures grows more complex as the number of platforms increases. Each additional yield platform adds another potential failure mode that must be monitored and managed. When governance approves a new platform integration, they must ensure the protocol has appropriate procedures to detect problems, halt operations if needed, and recover funds safely. More platforms provide better diversification but demand more sophisticated operational oversight.

## Built-in Safety Limits

No matter how well-intentioned, governance could potentially make mistakes. To prevent errors from causing serious harm, the protocol includes hard limits coded directly into the contracts that cannot be bypassed even by governance itself.

Withdrawal periods, for instance, cannot exceed 365 days regardless of what governance proposes. This hard cap prevents scenarios where users' funds could be locked indefinitely. Similarly, when returning from Emergency Mode to Normal Mode, a minimum 6-hour cooldown period ensures the protocol doesn't flip back and forth rapidly, which could create confusion and operational problems.

The protocol limits the number of active yield platforms to 10 maximum. This cap prevents governance from over-extending the system's complexity to a point where monitoring and managing all integrations becomes impractical. It forces governance to be selective about which platforms to integrate, choosing quality over quantity.

For CAT Pool triggers, several logical constraints are enforced mathematically. All percentages must fall between 0 and 100%—you can't have a 150% trigger that would never activate or a negative trigger that makes no sense. Tier 2 must trigger at a lower capital ratio than Tier 1, ensuring the intervention grows progressively stronger as conditions worsen. And Tier 2 must provide equal or greater coverage than Tier 1, preventing scenarios where early intervention provides more support than crisis intervention.

The following table summarizes these safety limits:

| Parameter Type | Hard Limit | Reason |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Withdrawal Periods | Max 365 days | Prevents indefinite lockup |
| Emergency Mode Exit | Min 6 hour cooldown | Prevents rapid mode switching |
| Yield Platforms | Max 10 active | Limits operational complexity |
| CAT Pool Triggers | 0-100%, Tier 2 < Tier 1 | Ensures logical intervention |
| CAT Pool Coverage | 0-100%, Tier 2 ≥ Tier 1 | Ensures progressive support |

These limits ensure that even if governance makes an error in judgment, the system prevents extreme configurations that could harm users.

## Emergency Actions

Sometimes crises demand immediate action. The Guardian role exists specifically to handle these situations where waiting for a 3-7 day governance review period could allow significant harm to occur.

The Guardian can immediately activate Emergency Mode or Guarded Mode in response to security threats or major market disruptions. They can also mark yield platforms as "failed" if evidence emerges of a hack, exploit, or critical operational problem. These powers allow the protocol to respond to threats in minutes rather than days.

However, these emergency powers come with important safeguards. All Guardian actions are logged on-chain along with detailed reasons, creating a permanent public record that can be audited by the community. The Guardian's authority extends only to defensive actions that protect users—they cannot make offensive changes like adjusting fees or coverage limits. Regular governance can reverse any Guardian action if it's deemed inappropriate, providing an important check on Guardian power. After any emergency action, the community conducts a thorough review to assess whether the response was justified and appropriate.

This structure creates a balance: the Guardian can act swiftly to protect users when needed, but they operate under scrutiny and constraints that prevent abuse of their emergency powers.
