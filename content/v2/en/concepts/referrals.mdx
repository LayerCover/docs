description: Fund discounts and earn on-chain rewards by distributing LayerCover.

LayerCover’s referral rails enable partners to fund user discounts and collect rewards without negatively impacting Liquidity Provider (LP) yields.

The system is designed for **Mutually Reinforcing Value**: end-users gain access to cheaper protection, referrers earn a transparent revenue stream, and the protocol scales its reach through trusted partners.

## Program at a Glance

Referral logic is executed fully on-chain. When a user purchases cover with your code, the discount is applied to their premium immediately, and your reward is settled in the same transaction.

| Component | Campaign Preset (Efficient Baseline) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Buyer Discount** | **2%** off base premium |
| **Referrer Reward** | **3%** of base premium |
| **Source of Funds** | Paid from the **Reinsurance (CAT) Tax** allocation, before LP share |

<Callout type="info">
  **Flexible Configuration:** Presets are stored on-chain, allowing governance to adjust acquisition spend without requiring contract migrations. You can run multiple codes across different wallets or campaigns simultaneously.

## How It Works

The purchase flow is atomic. There is no off-chain tracking pixel or monthly reconciliation; the **PolicyManager** and **ReferralManager** contracts handle the split instantly.



1.  **Purchase:** Buyer calls **purchaseCoverWithReferral(code)**.
2.  **Verification:** **ReferralManager** validates the code and calculates the splits.
3.  **Settlement:**
    * **Buyer:** Pays the discounted premium amount.
    * **Referrer:** Receives the reward instantly (or it accumulates in an on-chain balance).
    * **Protocol:** The remaining premium is routed to the pools.

> **Example:** On a policy with a **\$1,000** base premium using the 2%/3% preset:
> * **Buyer Pays:** \$980 (Instant \$20 saving).
> * **Referrer Earns:** \$30 (Reserved from the protocol's acquisition budget).
> * **LPs:** Receive their standard allocation, unaffected by the discount.
