LayerCover uses a fixed rate pricing system that provides stable, predictable costs for coverage buyers while ensuring underwriters earn competitive returns.

*   **[Fixed Rate](/concepts/pricing/intent-based)**: Intent-based deals lock capital for bespoke durations with deterministic pricing.

This page summarizes the core pricing mechanics. For a deep dive into the calculations and specific mechanics, please visit the sub-page.

## Pricing Model

| Feature | [Fixed Rate (Intent)](/concepts/pricing/intent-based) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ideal For** | Teams needing guaranteed budgets or institutional term deals |
| **Price Signal** | Quote agreed between buyer and underwriting syndicate |
| **Duration** | Coverage and capital are locked for the negotiated term |
| **Payment Flow** | Paid upfront |

## Key Benefits

### Cost Certainty
You pay exactly what was quoted at the time of purchase. $100k coverage for 90 days at 5% APR will cost exactly what the formula dictates, with no surprises.

### Capital Efficiency
Capital is reserved for each policy through the intent-based system. Underwriting Syndicates can offer competitive quotes based on their risk assessment and available capacity.

### Transparent Pricing
All quotes are visible in the orderbook, allowing buyers to compare rates across multiple syndicates and select the best option for their needs.
