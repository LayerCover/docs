## Reinsurance Layer

LayerCover’s Reinsurance Layer serves as the protocol-wide safety net. While primary underwriters manage specific risks, the Reinsurance Layer aggregates liquidity to ensure claims are paid even during extreme liquidity events or solvency shortfalls.

Unlike traditional markets where carriers negotiate bilateral reinsurance treaties, LayerCover uses a **Shared Asset Controller** to pool capital from all backstop providers and programmatically deploy it where needed.

## Reinsurance at a Glance

* **Purpose:** To guarantee claim settlement when a primary pool faces a solvency shortfall.
* **Architecture:** A **Shared Asset Controller** aggregates liquidity from multiple tranches (Junior, Mezzanine, Senior) to maximize capital efficiency.
* **Funding:** Funded by a "Reinsurance Tax"—a fixed percentage (default 20%) of all gross premiums is routed directly to this layer.
* **Activation:** Triggers automatically when a primary pool cannot fully cover a valid claim.

## The Capital Waterfall (Tranches)

The Reinsurance Layer is not a monolith; it is structured into **Tranche Vaults** with distinct risk/reward profiles. This is known as the "Loss Waterfall". When the backstop is called upon to pay a claim, capital is drawn in a strict reverse-priority order.



### 1. Junior Tranche (First Loss)
* **Role:** The first line of defense.
* **Risk:** Absorbs losses immediately after the primary pool is exhausted.
* **Reward:** Commands the highest share of the Reinsurance Tax to compensate for high exposure.

### 2. Mezzanine Tranche
* **Role:** The middle layer.
* **Risk:** Capital is drawn only after the Junior Tranche is fully depleted.
* **Reward:** Balances moderate risk with moderate yields.

### 3. Senior Tranche (Last Loss)
* **Role:** The ultimate safety net ($P_0$).
* **Risk:** Utilized only in catastrophic tail events where both Junior and Mezzanine layers are empty.
* **Reward:** Earns a lower, more predictable yield reflecting its protected status.

  **Yield Efficiency:** Idle capital from *all* tranches is pooled by the Shared Asset Controller and deployed into whitelisted Yield Adapters (e.g., Aave, Compound), ensuring the backstop earns external DeFi yield on top of reinsurance premiums.

## Trigger Logic: When Does It Activate?

The Reinsurance Layer activates strictly based on **Solvency Shortfalls**. It does not compete with primary underwriters; it supports them.

1.  **Primary First:** When a claim is validated, the protocol first attempts to settle it using the specific Risk Pool's pledged capital.
2.  **Shortfall Detection:** If the primary pool lacks sufficient liquid capital (e.g., due to heavy utilization or pending withdrawals), a **Solvency Shortfall** is detected.
3.  **Automatic Drawdown:** The Shared Asset Controller instantly unlocks the required funds from the Backstop tranches (Junior $\to$ Senior) to fill the gap.

This ensures that policyholders receive full payouts without delay, even if the specific pool they bought into is temporarily stressed.

## The Policyholder Experience

From a user's perspective, the interaction is seamless. The complexity of the waterfall is abstracted away.

* **Single Transaction:** You simply call **processClaim()**.
* **Atomic Settlement:** The protocol routes the payout from the primary pool and, if necessary, the Reinsurance Layer in a single atomic action.
* **Custody Agnostic:** Whether your claim involves a **Direct Swap** (transferring stablecoins) or a **Vault Cover** claim (transferring vault shares), the Reinsurance Layer backs the settlement value in the underlying unit of account.
* **Emergency Liquidity:** In extreme cases where underlying liquidity is unavailable, the Reinsurance Layer can transfer **aTokens** (yield-bearing strategy tokens) directly to the claimant to ensure settlement.
