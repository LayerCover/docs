LayerCover policies live entirely on-chain as transferable NFTs. The protocol offers fixed rate coverage that provides guaranteed protection for your assets.

## The Policy NFT

When you purchase cover, the protocol mints a **Policy NFT** to your wallet. This NFT is not just a receipt—it *is* your insurance policy.

*   **Transferable:** You can move the NFT between wallets (e.g., to a cold storage address or a multisig) without cancelling your coverage.
*   **Composable:** The NFT can be integrated into other DeFi protocols, used as collateral, or sold on secondary markets.
*   **Self-Custodied:** You hold the rights to the policy. No centralized database controls your access to claims.

## Fixed Rate Coverage

LayerCover uses a fixed rate model that provides stable, predictable protection for your assets.

## How to Buy

### 1. Browse Pools
Navigate to the [LayerCover App](https://app.layercover.com) and find the protocol or asset you want to cover. Risk ratings (e.g., A+, B) help you assess the safety of the underlying protocol compared to the cost of cover.

### 2. Configure Policy
Select your desired **Coverage Amount** and duration. You will select an expiry date and see quotes from Underwriting Syndicates.

### 3. Mint Policy & Cooldown
Confirm the transaction to mint your Policy NFT.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note:** A <strong>7-day cooldown period</strong> applies to newly purchased policies, during which claims cannot be filed. This mechanism protects the pool from users rushing to buy cover <em>after</em> a hack has already become public.
</Callout>

### 4. Manage Your Coverage
Use the LayerCover Dashboard to monitor your policy. Your coverage expires on the set date. You can purchase a new policy to roll over your protection.
