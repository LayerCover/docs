## Claims & Salvage Mechanics

In LayerCover, the claims process is designed to be **deterministic and mechanical**. There are no governance votes to decide if a claim is valid, and no "claims assessors" to negotiate payouts.

If the on-chain conditions are met (e.g., a policyholder surrenders the insured asset), the protocol executes the payout immediately.

As an underwriter, it is critical to understand how this process impacts your capital and how you recover potential value from the distressed assets (Salvage).

## 1. The Payout Process (Loss Realization)

When a claim is processed, the protocol performs an atomic exchange: the policyholder gets the cover amount, and the pool gets the distressed asset.

### Immediate Settlement
Unlike traditional insurance where claims can take months, LayerCover settlements happen in a single transaction.
* **Oracle-Free:** The system does not rely on price feeds to verify a loss. It uses a "Put Option" logic: if the user holds the insured token and wants to swap it for the cover amount, the claim is valid.
* **Price Neutrality:** At the exact moment a claim is paid, the protocol takes a "snapshot" of the pool. It reserves the necessary shares for the payout so that the Net Asset Value (NAV) doesn't jump irrationally, ensuring fairness between underwriters who are entering or exiting.

### Pro-Rata Liability
You cannot avoid a loss by withdrawing immediately after an event.
* **The "Event Block" ($t_0$):** The protocol records the total eligible capital pledged to the pool at the exact block the claim occurs.
* **Your Share:** Your liability is fixed based on your percentage of the pool *at that specific moment*. Even if other underwriters withdraw later, your specific liability amount remains locked to that snapshot.
* **Share Burning:** The loss is settled by burning a portion of your pool shares. You will see your share balance decrease, but the Price-Per-Share (PPS) of the remaining capital remains stable.

## 2. Salvage: Recovering Value

A claim is not a total loss. In exchange for the payout, the pool acquires the **Salvage**—the distressed assets surrendered by the policyholder.

As an underwriter, you effectively "bought" these assets at the moment of the claim. You have a legal and technical entitlement to your share of them.

### Types of Salvage Custody

Depending on the nature of the asset, salvage is handled in one of two ways:

#### Model A: Direct Swap (Stablecoins)
Used when the insured token (e.g., a de-pegged stablecoin) can be transferred.
* **Action:** The policyholder sends the tokens to the pool.
* **Result:** The pool now holds these tokens. You can claim your pro-rata share of them immediately.

#### Model B: Vault Cover (ERC-4626 Vaults)
Used for yield-bearing vault positions. Policyholders keep their vault shares until claim time.
* **Snapshot:** At purchase, the protocol records the USDC value of the vault shares. The policyholder retains full custody.
* **Claim:** When claiming, the policyholder transfers their vault shares to the protocol and receives an instant USDC payout at the snapshotted value.
* **Tradeable Claims:** Even if the underlying vault is frozen or devalued, your right to salvage assets is tokenized. You can trade your salvage rights on secondary markets.

## 3. How to Claim Salvage

Your entitlement to salvage is static. It does not get diluted if new underwriters join the pool after the claim.

$$
\text{Your Entitlement} = \text{Total Salvage} \times \frac{\text{Your Pledge at } t_0}{\text{Total Pool Capital at } t_0}
$$

1.  **Wait for Resolution:** In many cases, "distressed" assets recover value (e.g., a peg is restored, or a DAO negotiates a partial hack refund).
2.  **Claim Assets:** You can interact with the pool to withdraw your specific share of the salvage tokens to your wallet.
3.  **Liquidation:** Once withdrawn, you can sell these assets on the open market to offset your realized loss.



A common question for underwriters is: *"Why would I want a claim to a frozen asset? Doesn't 'frozen' mean the money is gone?"*

History shows that "frozen" does not always mean "zero." Protocols often recover funds through white-hat negotiations, law enforcement actions, or community bailouts.

The **Salvage Rights** mechanism allows you to hold a tokenized right to this potential recovery. If the protocol recovers, your salvage tokens become redeemable for the underlying assets.

## Case Study 1: Euler Finance (The "Full Recovery")
**The Event:** In March 2023, the lending protocol Euler Finance suffered a flash loan attack, losing approximately **\$200 million**.
* **The Freeze:** The protocol was effectively drained, and operations halted.
* **The LayerCover Scenario:** If you had underwritten Euler on LayerCover, the claim would have triggered immediately. You would have paid out the policyholders and received **tokenized salvage rights** to the frozen/stolen Euler assets.
* **The Recovery:** Over the next three weeks, the attacker entered negotiations and eventually **returned all recoverable funds** (approx. \$177M) to the protocol's treasury.
* **The Outcome:** The "worthless" salvage rights you held would have suddenly become redeemable for near-full value.

**Why Tokenization Matters Here:**
Without LayerCover's tokenized salvage, you would just be waiting in the dark. With tokenized salvage, a secondary market could form during those three weeks.
* *Risk-Averse Underwriters* could sell their claim tokens for 10 cents on the dollar immediately after the hack to exit.
* *Distressed Asset Buyers* could buy them, betting on a recovery, and ultimately profit when the funds were returned.

## Case Study 2: Poly Network (The "White Hat" Negotiation)
**The Event:** In August 2021, a hacker drained **\$610 million** from Poly Network.
* **The Recovery:** The team opened a dialogue with the attacker (dubbed "Mr. White Hat"). Over 15 days, the hacker returned nearly all the assets.
* **The Outcome:** Similar to Euler, the "frozen" assets were unblocked. Underwriters holding salvage rights would have recovered nearly 100% of the loss *after* the claim had already been settled.

## Case Study 3: Curve Finance (The Partial Recovery)
**The Event:** In July 2023, certain Curve pools were exploited due to a bug in the Vyper compiler.
* **The Recovery:** While not all funds were recovered, ethical hackers and MEV bots front-ran some of the malicious transactions and returned millions of dollars to the affected protocols (like Alchemix).
* **The Outcome:** This represents a **Partial Recovery**. If you held salvage tokens for these pools, they wouldn't return to \$1.00, but they might recover to \$0.70 or \$0.80, allowing you to recoup a significant portion of your underwriting loss.

## Summary Example

1.  **The Event:** You pledge **\$10k** to a pool with **\$100k** TVL (10% share). A hack occurs, and a policyholder claims **$50k**.
2.  **The Loss:** The pool pays out \$50k. Your share of the loss is **\$5k** (10% of \$50k). Your deposited principal is effectively reduced to $5k.
3.  **The Salvage:** The policyholder surrenders **50,000 badTokens** (the insured asset) to the pool.
4.  **The Recovery:** You legally own 10% of those tokens (5,000 badTokens).
5.  **The Outcome:** If badToken recovers to \$0.50, your 5,000 tokens are worth \$2,500.
    * **Net Loss:** \$5,000 (Payout) - \$2,500 (Salvage Value) = **\$2,500 Realized Loss**.
