---

LayerCover adapts traditional insurance discipline to on-chain underwriting. The protocol provides transparent guardrails including risk ratings, point budgets, and solvency checks that shape how capital is deployed.

While Syndicate Managers retain the authority to make allocation decisions, this framework ensures that systemic risks remain bounded within strict solvency limits.

<Callout type="info">
  **Institutional Grade:** Our risk framework maps directly to the **Solvency II** capital requirements used in traditional insurance. Pool Ratings correspond to SCR calibrations, and Risk Points mirror portfolio concentration limits.

## Risk Rating Framework

Every underwriting pool is assigned a discrete rating (AAA through C) based on protocol maturity, audit depth, and incident history.

This rating determines the **Risk Cost** of the capital you pledge. High-quality pools (AAA) consume fewer risk points, allowing for higher leverage. Experimental pools (C) are expensive to underwrite, mechanically throttling their exposure before they can dominate the book.

| Risk Rating | Risk Cost | Max Leverage Capacity | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AAA** | 1 point | 20x | Top-tier protocols (e.g., Aave, Uniswap) |
| **AA** | 2 points | 10x | Established protocols with long track records |
| **A** | 3 points | 6.7x | Mature protocols with proven security |
| **BBB** | 4 points | 5x | Solid protocols with some history |
| **BB** | 5 points | 4x | Emerging protocols with audits |
| **B** | 6 points | 3.3x | Newer protocols with higher risk |
| **C** | 7 points | 2.9x | Experimental or high-risk protocols |

## The Risk Points Budget

Underwriters operate within a finite **Risk Points Budget** (Default: 20 Points).

This budget acts as a strict, non-risk-based leverage cap. You cannot pledge capital if it would cause your total risk consumption to exceed this limit.

$$
\text{Points Used} = \sum (\text{Active Pledge}_i \times \text{Risk Cost}_i) \le \text{Total Budget}
$$

### Example Scenario
Consider a **\$1M principal** with a 20-point budget:
1.  **Allocation 1:** \$1M to Aave (AAA, 1 pt) $\rightarrow$ Uses **1 point**.
2.  **Allocation 2:** \$1M to Uniswap (AA, 2 pts) $\rightarrow$ Uses **2 points**.
3.  **Allocation 3:** \$1M to Curve (A, 3 pts) $\rightarrow$ Uses **3 points**.

**Total:** You have underwritten **$3M** of coverage (3x leverage) and consumed **6 of your 20 points**. This leaves ample headroom for further allocations, provided they fit within the remaining budget.



## Correlation Controls (Mutex Groups)

Risk points strictly limit leverage, but they do not capture correlation. To prevent contagion, LayerCover enforces **Mutex Groups** (Mutually Exclusive Groups).

* **The Rule:** You can only underwrite *one* pool per correlated cluster at a time.
* **The Logic:** If two pools share a critical dependency (e.g., two stablecoins both backed by USDC), a failure in one likely implies a failure in the other.
* **Enforcement:** Attempting to pledge to **Pool A** while already active in **Pool B** (if both are in the same Mutex group) will cause the transaction to revert.

## Solvency: The Coverage Floor

The protocol prioritizes solvency over liquidity. The **Underwriter Manager** enforces a hard floor: your pledged collateral must *always* exceed the coverage you have sold plus any pending losses.

$$
\text{Pledged Capital} \ge \text{Coverage Sold} + \text{Pending Losses}
$$

If a pool becomes over-utilized (e.g., due to a claim), withdrawals are automatically paused until the floor is restored.

| Scenario | Pledged | Coverage Sold | Available to Withdraw | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Healthy** | \$10M | \$7M | $3M | ✅ Active |
| **Stressed** | \$5M | \$4.8M | $0.2M | ⚠️ Restricted |
| **Breached** | \$5M | \$5.1M | $0 | ❌ Locked |

This mechanism ensures that "lazy" capital cannot exit during a crisis, protecting the system's ability to pay claims.

## Governance & Updates

Risk ratings and Mutex definitions are managed by the Risk Committee and updated via governance.

* **New Allocations:** Updates take effect immediately for all new pledges.
* **Existing Positions:** If a pool is downgraded (e.g., A $\rightarrow$ B), your risk usage increases. If this pushes you over your budget, you may be required to unwind positions to return to compliance.
