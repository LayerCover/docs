## How parameters change

LayerCover uses governance-controlled smart contracts to ensure updates follow transparent procedures:

1. **Governance proposals** – token holders can vote to adjust premiums, add pools, or retune limits. Successful proposals pass through a timelock before execution.
2. **Committee actions** – the risk committee can pause pools, redirect fees, or recommend parameter changes in emergencies; all actions are logged on-chain.
3. **Guardian controls** – the guardian multisig can pause the protocol in critical scenarios but cannot rewrite configuration on its own.
