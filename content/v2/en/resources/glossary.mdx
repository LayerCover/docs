## General Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Coverage** | The amount of protection a policy provides, denominated in the underlying asset (e.g., USDC). This represents the maximum payout amount if a valid claim is filed. |
| **Policy** | An insurance contract represented as an ERC-721 NFT. Each policy includes a coverage amount, premium paid, pool assignment, and fixed duration. Policyholders can transfer, trade, or claim against their policies. |
| **Premium** | The fixed upfront cost of insurance coverage, paid by the policyholder at purchase. Premiums are distributed to underwriters, the Backstop Pool, and the protocol treasury. |
| **Claim** | A request for payout when a covered event occurs. For standard pools, policyholders submit distressed assets (e.g., depegged stablecoins) along with their policy NFT. For optimistic/parametric pools, claims are resolved via UMA Optimistic Oracle. |
| **Salvage** | Distressed assets received from claimants during the claims process. Salvage is distributed pro-rata to underwriters who were backing the policy at T0 (the claim block). For optimistic pools, there is no salvage. |

## Capital & Underwriting

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Underwriter** | A capital provider who deposits funds into a Syndicate to back insurance policies and earns premiums and yield in exchange for taking on insurance risk. |
| **Capital Pool** | The main ERC-4626 vault where syndicate capital is aggregated. CapitalPool manages allocation, yield generation through external protocols, and claim payouts. |
| **Shares** | ERC-20 tokens representing ownership in a Syndicate vault or the CapitalPool. Share value rises as premiums and yield accrue and falls when claims generate losses. |
| **Principal** | The original amount of capital an underwriter deposited, tracked separately from gains and losses to reveal true P&L. |
| **Allocation** | Committing capital from a Syndicate to back a specific insurance pool, defining exposure to that pool's risks and claims. |
| **Pledge** | The amount of capital a syndicate has allocated to a specific pool, defining exposure to that pool's risks and claims. |
| **Risk Points** | A point budget (default 100 per syndicate) limiting how much risk a syndicate can take. Riskier pools consume more risk points per unit of pledged capital. |
| **Coverage Floor** | Minimum capital requirement per pool that keeps policies fully backed during deallocations, preventing undercollateralization. |
| **Per-Pool Concentration Limit** | Maximum pledge to any single pool, enforced as a percentage of principal (default: 35%). Prevents over-concentration of risk in a single pool. Governance can grant per-syndicate overrides for captive syndicates. |
| **Capital Adequacy Ratio** | Minimum ratio of principal to total pledged exposure (default: 50%). Syndicates below this threshold cannot write new business until recapitalized. Mirrors Lloyd's Solvency Capital Requirement. |

---

## Pools & Risk

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pool** | A grouping of insurance policies covering a specific protocol or risk type (e.g., "Aave USDC"). Each pool has unique parameters that define coverage terms. |
| **Premium Rate** | The annual cost of coverage expressed as APR. In LayerCover's fixed-rate model, rates are set by syndicate managers when they create quotes (intents) in the orderbook. |
| **Risk Rating** | Letter grade (e.g., AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B/C) classifying pool risk. Higher risk ratings consume more risk points per unit of pledged capital, limiting leverage. |
| **Mutex Group** | A set of pools that cover correlated risks. When multiple pools from the same group are allocated together, their risk costs compound to account for correlated loss exposure. |

---

## Syndicates

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Syndicate** | A professionally managed underwriting vault (ERC-4626) where depositors let a manager allocate capital on their behalf. Comparable to a managed fund at Lloyd's of London. |
| **Syndicate Manager** | The address authorized to manage allocations, strategy, and risk for a syndicate. Earns incentives via performance fees. |
| **Performance Fee** | Percentage of profits paid to the manager (capped at 20%), charged only on gains above the high-water mark. |
| **High-Water Mark** | The previous peak share price of the syndicate. Performance fees apply only when returns exceed this benchmark. |
| **Auto-Allocation** | Automated deployment of deposits into pre-configured pools following the manager's strategy. |
| **Reserve Ratio** | Portion of assets kept idle to meet withdrawals (e.g., 5%). Ensures redeemability without disrupting allocations. |

---

## Reinsurance

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Backstop Pool** | The protocol-wide catastrophic reserve funded by a percentage of all premiums. Provides liquidity when syndicate capital and 3rd party reinsurance are insufficient to cover claims. |
| **SharedAssetController** | Smart contract that manages the Backstop Pool, receiving backstop premium contributions, deploying capital to yield strategies, and providing emergency liquidity. |
| **Backstop Pool Share** | Percentage of premiums routed to the Backstop Pool for catastrophe coverage. Configurable via `backstopPremiumBps`. |
| **Reinsurance Hook** | Optional smart contract integration (`IReinsuranceHook`) allowing syndicates to connect to external 3rd party reinsurers for additional underwriting capacity and proportional risk sharing. |
| **Third-Party Reinsurer** | External entity approved by a syndicate manager to provide additional reinsurance capacity via the hook-based integration system. Premium and losses are shared proportionally based on the reinsured portion of each policy. |

---

## Claims & Payouts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Claim Processing** | Automated sequence for paying claims: <ol><li>Validate policy ownership and token submission</li><li>Snapshot underwriter pledges at T0</li><li>Execute payout waterfall</li><li>Distribute salvage to T0 underwriters</li></ol> |
| **Payout Waterfall** | Ordered funding sources for claims: <ol><li>Pool capital (syndicate pledges)</li><li>3rd party reinsurance (if configured for the syndicate)</li><li>Backstop Pool (protocol-wide reserve)</li><li>Protocol Treasury (last resort)</li></ol> If all layers are exhausted, the claim is partially paid. |
| **T0 (Time Zero)** | Block number when a claim is filed. Underwriter positions snapshot at T0 to lock salvage rights and prevent gaming. |
| **Checkpointed Salvage** | Mechanism tying salvage rights to the underwriters backing a policy at T0, blocking late entrants from claiming salvage. |

---

## Yield & Rewards

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Yield Adapter** | Smart contract integrating with external DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.) to deploy idle capital and generate yield. Each adapter targets a specific protocol/asset. |
| **aTokens** | Aave interest-bearing tokens (e.g., aUSDC) that automatically accrue yield as the lending pool earns interest. |
| **cTokens** | Compound interest-bearing tokens (e.g., cUSDCv3) that function similarly to aTokens for the Compound protocol. |
| **Reward Distributor** | Contract that records premium earnings per pool and distributes them to underwriters based on their pledges. |
| **Harvest** | Process of collecting yield from external protocols and crediting it back to the CapitalPool. Anyone can trigger harvests on a regular cadence. |

---

## Withdrawals & Deallocations

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Withdrawal** | Pulling capital out of a Syndicate. Unlocked capital (not backing active policies) can be withdrawn by redeeming shares. |
| **Capital Locking** | Capital backing active policies is locked and cannot be withdrawn until those policies expire or settle, protecting against claim front-running. |
| **Deallocation** | Reducing capital allocated from a syndicate to a specific pool. Managed by the syndicate manager, subject to coverage floor constraints. |
| **Backstop Pool Notice Period** | The Backstop Pool may impose a waiting window before withdrawals complete, separate from syndicate rules. |

---

## Governance & Administration

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ProtocolConfigurator** | Central admin hub - the owner-controlled contract that manages pool configuration, fees, system parameters, and contract upgrades. Owned by a DAO multisig or timelock. |
| **Committee** | A single privileged address (typically a multisig) with limited emergency powers: pausing and unpausing pools during incidents. Cannot change parameters, move funds, or modify claim logic. |
| **Incident Reporting** | Emergency process where the committee flags a covered event (e.g., hack, depeg) and pauses the affected pool, blocking new policy purchases while existing policies and claims remain active. |
| **UMA Optimistic Oracle** | Decentralized dispute resolution system used for parametric and ecosystem risk claims. Claimants post a bond and assertion; if undisputed during a liveness period, the claim is approved automatically. Disputes are resolved by UMA token-holder vote. |
| **COVR Token** | The protocol's ERC-20 governance token with a fixed supply cap of 1 billion. Supports burning and EIP-2612 gasless approvals. |

---

## Technical Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ERC-4626** | Tokenized vault standard used by CapitalPool and Syndicates, providing a common interface for deposits, withdrawals, and accounting. |
| **ERC-721 (NFT)** | Non-fungible token standard where each policy is a unique token that can be transferred, traded, or pledged as collateral. |
| **Basis Points (BPS)** | Unit that expresses percentages in hundredths of a percent; 100 bps equals 1%, so a 500 bps fee equals 5%. |
| **Intent** | An off-chain signed quote (EIP-712) from a syndicate manager specifying a rate, pool, and capacity. Buyers select intents from the orderbook to purchase coverage atomically. |
| **IntentMatcher** | Smart contract that atomically matches buyer and seller intents - locking capital, transferring premium, and minting the policy NFT in a single transaction. |
| **SystemRegistry** | Service locator contract that provides protocol-wide dynamic dependency resolution. All core contracts resolve their dependencies through the registry at runtime. |
| **Revert** | Transaction failure that rolls back all state changes because validation failed, balances were insufficient, or another error occurred. |

---

## Actions & Operations

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Mint** | Creation of new tokens such as Syndicate shares or policy NFTs; occurs when users deposit capital or purchase policies. |
| **Burn** | Destruction of tokens, typically happening when shares are redeemed during withdrawals or policies are closed after claims. |
| **Settle** | Automatic process that applies pending rewards, fees, and losses to bring account balances up to date during an interaction. |
| **Harvest** | Action that pulls accumulated yield from external protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.) back into the CapitalPool for distribution. |
| **Rebalance** | Adjustment of capital allocations across pools to maintain a target strategy, respond to market changes, or manage risk. |
| **Sweep** | Retrieval of unclaimed salvage after a grace period expires, allowing governance to redistribute or allocate the recovered assets. |

---

## Referrals

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Referral Code** | Unique bytes32 identifier that policyholders can enter during purchase to trigger rewards for the referrer. |
| **Referrer** | User who registers a referral code and earns a share of premiums whenever their code is used. |
| **Referrer Reward** | Portion of premium (e.g., 5%) paid to the referrer as a commission to incentivize user acquisition. |

---

## Emergency & Safety

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Emergency Mode** | Protective state where withdrawals rely solely on idle capital, bypassing yield adapters when external protocols appear compromised. |
| **Pause** | Temporary suspension of new policy purchases on a pool, initiated by the committee to mitigate threats during an incident. Existing policies and claims remain active. |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Automated safety layer (DIA-based) that monitors asset prices and heartbeats, automatically pausing new cover issuance if thresholds are breached or data becomes stale. |
| **Failed Adapter** | Yield adapter flagged as non-functional, blocking new deposits and triggering emergency withdrawal procedures for its positions. |
| **Reentrancy Guard** | Contract pattern that prevents recursive calls during execution, protecting against reentrancy exploits. |
| **Access Control** | Role-based permission system that restricts access to sensitive functions across the protocol. |

---

## Events & Monitoring

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Event** | On-chain log emitted by contracts to announce state changes such as deposits, claims, or allocation updates. |
| **Subgraph** | Indexed dataset accessible via GraphQL that aggregates LayerCover activity for analytics and app consumption. |
| **Entity** | Structured representation within the subgraph that models protocol objects like policies, pools, or claims. |
| **Query** | Data request sent to the subgraph or blockchain to retrieve filtered, sorted, or aggregated information. |

---

## Mathematical Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pro-Rata** | Distribution method that allocates amounts proportional to each participant's share of the total, used for salvage, losses, and rewards. |
| **Share Price** | For ERC-4626 vaults, `Total Assets / Total Shares`; rises with premiums and yield, falls when losses occur. |
| **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)** | Yearly return measure that includes compounding, commonly used to present underwriting yields. |
| **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** | Yearly rate without compounding, typically used to quote policy premium rates. |

---

## Related Protocols

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Aave** | Decentralized lending protocol that LayerCover integrates with for both yield generation on idle capital and insurance coverage products. |
| **Compound** | Lending protocol used similarly to Aave for earning yield and backing insurance offerings within LayerCover. |
| **Chainlink** | Decentralized oracle network that can supply price feeds, rate data, and other external information to the protocol. |
| **UMA** | Decentralized optimistic oracle and dispute resolution protocol used by LayerCover for parametric and ecosystem risk claim resolution. |
| **USDC / USDT / DAI** | Leading stablecoins that act as the primary assets for policy coverage amounts and underwriting deposits. |
