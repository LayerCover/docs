## General Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Coverage** | The amount of protection a policy provides, denominated in the underlying asset (e.g., USDC). This represents the maximum payout amount if a valid claim is filed. |
| **Policy** | An insurance contract represented as an ERC-721 NFT. Each policy includes a coverage amount, premium balance, and pool assignment. Policyholders can transfer, trade, or claim against their policies. |
| **Premium** | The cost of insurance coverage, paid by the policyholder. Premiums are distributed to underwriters backing the policy and the CAT (catastrophic) pool for reinsurance protection. |
| **Claim** | A request for payout when a covered event occurs. To file a claim, the policyholder must submit the required protocol tokens (e.g., depegged stablecoins) along with their policy NFT. |
| **Salvage** | Protocol tokens recovered from claimants during the claims process. Salvage is distributed pro-rata to underwriters who were backing the policy at the time of claim (T0). |

---

## Capital & Underwriting

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Underwriter** | A capital provider who deposits funds into the protocol to back insurance policies and earns premiums and yield in exchange for taking on insurance risk. |
| **Capital Pool** | The main ERC-4626 vault where underwriters deposit capital. CapitalPool manages allocation, yield generation through external protocols, and claim payouts. |
| **Shares** | ERC-20 tokens representing ownership in the CapitalPool. Share value rises as premiums and yield accrue and falls when claims generate losses. |
| **Principal** | The original amount of capital an underwriter deposited, tracked separately from gains and losses to reveal true P&L. |
| **Allocation** | Committing capital from the CapitalPool to back a specific insurance pool. Underwriters can allocate across pools subject to risk point limits. |
| **Pledge** | The amount of capital an underwriter has allocated to a specific pool, defining exposure to that pool’s risks and claims. |
| **Risk Points** | A 12-point budget limiting how much risk an underwriter can take. Riskier pools consume more points per unit of capital. |
| **Coverage Floor** | Minimum capital requirement per pool that keeps policies fully backed during deallocations, preventing undercollateralization. |

---

## Pools & Risk

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pool** | A grouping of insurance policies covering a specific protocol or risk type (e.g., “Aave USDC”). Each pool has unique parameters and a rate model. |
| **Pool Utilization** | The percentage of available capital sold as coverage. Formula: `Utilization = Coverage Sold / Total Capital Available`. Higher utilization usually increases premium rates. |
| **Premium Rate** | The annual cost of coverage expressed as APR. Rates are dynamically calculated from pool utilization and the pool’s rate model. |
| **Rate Model** | A utilization-based curve that sets premium rates. Key parameters include: <ul><li><strong>Base Rate</strong>: Minimum rate at 0% utilization</li><li><strong>Kink</strong>: Utilization level where the curve steepens</li><li><strong>Slope 1</strong>: Rate increase below the kink</li><li><strong>Slope 2</strong>: Accelerated increase above the kink</li></ul> |
| **Risk Rating** | Letter grade (e.g., A, B, C) classifying pool risk. Higher risk ratings require more risk points to allocate capital, limiting exposure. |
| **Mutex Group** | A set of pools that cannot be allocated simultaneously. Prevents concentration risk by forcing underwriters to choose one pool per group. |

---

## Syndicates

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Syndicate** | A professionally managed underwriting vault (ERC-4626) where depositors let a manager allocate capital on their behalf. Comparable to a managed fund. |
| **Syndicate Manager** | The address authorized to manage allocations, strategy, and risk for a syndicate. Earns incentives via performance fees. |
| **Performance Fee** | Percentage of profits paid to the manager (capped at 20%), charged only on gains above the high-water mark. |
| **High-Water Mark** | The previous peak share price of the syndicate. Performance fees apply only when returns exceed this benchmark. |
| **Auto-Allocation** | Automated deployment of deposits into pre-configured pools following the manager’s strategy. |
| **Reserve Ratio** | Portion of assets kept idle to meet withdrawals (e.g., 5%). Ensures redeemability without disrupting allocations. |

---

## Reinsurance

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CAT Pool** | The catastrophic backstop for extreme loss events. Structured into tranches with varying risk/reward profiles. |
| **SharedAssetController** | Smart contract that manages CAT pool tranches and coordinates loss distribution according to priority. |
| **Tranche** | A CAT pool layer with a defined loss priority. Each tranche is an ERC-4626 vault targeting a specific risk profile. |
| **Priority** | Numerical ranking for loss absorption order (0 = junior/first loss; higher numbers = senior/last loss). |
| **Junior Tranche** | First-loss tranche offering highest potential yield and absorbing claims before other tranches. |
| **Senior Tranche** | Last-loss tranche with lowest risk and yield, tapped only after junior and mezzanine tranches are exhausted. |

---

## Claims & Payouts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Claim Processing** | Automated sequence for paying claims: <ol><li>Validate policy ownership and token submission</li><li>Snapshot underwriter pledges at T0</li><li>Execute payout waterfall</li><li>Distribute salvage to T0 underwriters</li></ol> |
| **Payout Waterfall** | Ordered funding sources for claims: <ol><li>Yield adapter withdrawals (Aave, Compound, etc.)</li><li>Emergency interest-bearing token transfers</li><li>CAT pool draw if capital is insufficient</li></ol> |
| **T0 (Time Zero)** | Block number when a claim is filed. Underwriter positions snapshot at T0 to lock salvage rights and prevent gaming. |
| **Checkpointed Salvage** | Mechanism tying salvage rights to the underwriters backing a policy at T0, blocking late entrants from claiming salvage. |

---

## Yield & Rewards

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Yield Adapter** | Smart contract integrating with external DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.) to deploy idle capital and generate yield. Each adapter targets a specific protocol/asset. |
| **aTokens** | Aave interest-bearing tokens (e.g., aUSDC) that automatically accrue yield as the lending pool earns interest. |
| **cTokens** | Compound interest-bearing tokens (e.g., cUSDCv3) that function similarly to aTokens for the Compound protocol. |
| **Reward Distributor** | Contract that records premium earnings per pool and distributes them to underwriters based on their pledges. |
| **Loss Distributor** | Contract that allocates claim losses to underwriters pro-rata using pledges at the time of the claim. |
| **Harvest** | Process of collecting yield from external protocols and crediting it back to the CapitalPool. Anyone can trigger harvests on a regular cadence. |

---

## Withdrawals & Deallocations

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Withdrawal Request** | Instruction to pull capital out of the CapitalPool, subject to a notice period before execution. |
| **Notice Period** | Mandatory waiting window (e.g., 7 days) before withdrawals or deallocations complete, protecting against sudden exits. |
| **Deallocation Request** | Request to reduce capital allocated to a specific pool, also governed by the notice period for stability. |
| **Matured Request** | Withdrawal or deallocation that has satisfied its notice period and can now be executed. |
| **Pending Withdrawal Shares** | Shares locked in withdrawal requests awaiting execution; they stop earning new rewards but still bear losses. |

---

## Governance

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Committee** | Governance token stakers entrusted with special permissions—pausing pools, setting fees, reporting incidents—and acting quickly during emergencies. |
| **Incident Reporting** | Committee-led process that flags covered events (e.g., hacks, depegs) and can pause affected pools to prevent new policy sales while claims are evaluated. |
| **Staking** | Locking governance tokens to earn rewards, gain voting rights, and become eligible for committee duties or other delegated responsibilities. |
| **Governance Proposal** | Formal change request covering parameters, features, or upgrades that token holders vote on through the governance process. |

---

## Technical Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ERC-4626** | Tokenized vault standard used by CapitalPool, Syndicates, and Tranche Vaults, providing a common interface for deposits, withdrawals, and accounting. |
| **ERC-721 (NFT)** | Non-fungible token standard where each policy is a unique token that can be transferred, traded, or pledged as collateral. |
| **Basis Points (BPS)** | Unit that expresses percentages in hundredths of a percent; 100 bps equals 1%, so a 500 bps fee equals 5%. |
| **Slippage** | Difference between expected and actual execution outcomes when a transaction processes, often driven by utilization changes or market moves. |
| **Revert** | Transaction failure that rolls back all state changes because validation failed, balances were insufficient, or another error occurred. |
| **Gas Optimization** | Techniques that reduce transaction costs, such as batching operations, minimizing storage writes, and avoiding unnecessary external calls. |

---

## Actions & Operations

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Mint** | Creation of new tokens such as CapitalPool shares or policy NFTs; occurs when users deposit capital or purchase policies. |
| **Burn** | Destruction of tokens, typically happening when shares are redeemed during withdrawals or policies are closed after claims. |
| **Settle** | Automatic process that applies pending rewards, fees, and losses to bring account balances up to date during an interaction. |
| **Harvest** | Action that pulls accumulated yield from external protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.) back into the CapitalPool for distribution. |
| **Rebalance** | Adjustment of capital allocations across pools to maintain a target strategy, respond to utilization changes, or manage risk. |
| **Sweep** | Retrieval of unclaimed salvage after a grace period expires, allowing governance to redistribute or allocate the recovered assets. |

---

## Referrals

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Referral Code** | Unique bytes32 identifier that policyholders can enter during purchase to trigger rewards and discounts. |
| **Referrer** | User who registers a referral code and earns a share of premiums whenever their code is used. |
| **Buyer Discount** | Premium reduction offered to policyholders who enter a referral code, often expressed as a percentage like 3%. |
| **Referrer Reward** | Portion of premium (for example, 5%) paid to the referrer to incentivize user acquisition and marketing. |

---

## Emergency & Safety

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Emergency Mode** | Protective state where withdrawals rely solely on idle capital, bypassing yield adapters when external protocols appear compromised. |
| **Pause** | Temporary suspension of actions such as deposits or policy purchases, initiated by governance or the committee to mitigate threats. |
| **Failed Adapter** | Yield adapter flagged as non-functional, blocking new deposits and triggering emergency withdrawal procedures for its positions. |
| **Reentrancy Guard** | Contract pattern that prevents recursive calls during execution, protecting against reentrancy exploits. |
