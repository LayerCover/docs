## Business Source License (BUSL-1.1)

LayerCover core smart contracts are released under the **Business Source License 1.1**. This means:

- ✅ **Auditable** - Source code is fully readable and verifiable
- ✅ **Testable** - You can compile, test, and study the contracts locally
- ❌ **No forking** - Commercial use or deployment of modified contracts is restricted
- 🗓️ **Change Date** - Each repository specifies a date when the license converts to a permissive open-source license (typically 2–4 years from publication)

This is the same licensing model used by Uniswap, Aave, and other leading DeFi protocols.
