LayerCover is built in public. Join the community to follow protocol updates, share feedback, or contribute code and documentation.

## Official Channels

### Discord

Primary hub for support, governance updates, and real-time discussion. Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/layercover) and watch the **#announcements**, **#governance**, and **#developers** channels for release notes and integration help.

### Twitter / X

Follow [@LayerCover](https://twitter.com/LayerCover) for high-level announcements, protocol milestones, and community spotlights.

### Telegram

Prefer mobile-first chats? Subscribe to the [Telegram broadcast](https://t.me/layercover) for condensed updates and incident alerts.

### GitHub

Track roadmap progress, open issues, or submit pull requests in the [LayerCover GitHub organization](https://github.com/LayerCover). Documentation improvements live in the `docs` repositories, while protocol changes are handled in the smart contract packages.

## Programs & Contributions

- **Referral program**: Grow coverage demand and earn rewards by following the process outlined in [Referrals](/concepts/referrals).
- **Bug bounty**: Security researchers can monitor the [Security & Audits](/resources/audits) page for the latest bounty scope and payout structure.
- **Governance**: Learn how proposals move through the pipeline in [Governance Overview](/governance/governance) and participate in RFC threads before on-chain votes.
- **Documentation**: Found an issue? Open a GitHub issue or submit a pull request—most pages list their source path in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

## Community Guidelines

1. **Stay respectful** – professional discourse keeps the signal high.
2. **Protect sensitive data** – never share private keys, seed phrases, or personal information in community forums.
3. **Flag incidents quickly** – suspected bugs or security issues should be reported privately to [security@layercover.com](mailto:security@layercover.com) before posting publicly.
4. **Keep discussions constructive** – cite data, dashboards, or on-chain evidence when debating governance or risk topics.

## Support

- **Protocol support**: Post in **#support** on Discord for general questions.
- **Integration help**: Use the **#developers** channel or tag maintainers on GitHub.
- **Partnerships & ecosystem**: Email [ecosystem@layercover.com](mailto:ecosystem@layercover.com) to discuss integrations, referral campaigns, or co-marketing ideas.
