## For Policyholders

<FAQAccordion faqs={[
  {
    question: "What happens if a protocol I'm covered for gets hacked?",
    answer: "You can file a claim immediately through the LayerCover dashboard. The process works like an American-style put option: you transfer your affected assets to the protocol and receive an instant USDC payout at your covered value. No governance votes, no waiting periods. See [Filing Claims](/policyholders/filing-claims) for the full process."
  },
  {
    question: "How long until my claim is paid?",
    answer: "Instantly. Claims are settled in a single on-chain transaction. The moment your claim transaction is confirmed, the USDC is in your wallet."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the 7-day cooldown period?",
    answer: "When you purchase a new policy, there's a 7-day window before you can file claims. This prevents opportunistic purchases immediately after an exploit becomes public. Coverage still begins at purchase, but you cannot claim during this initial period."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel my policy early?",
    answer: "Yes. You can cancel any fixed-rate policy before expiration and receive a pro-rata refund of the unused premium. For example, canceling a 90-day policy after 30 days refunds approximately 2/3 of your premium."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I transfer my policy to another wallet?",
    answer: "Yes. Policies are represented as NFTs and are fully transferable. The current holder of the Policy NFT has the right to file claims."
  },
  {
    question: "What assets can I get coverage for?",
    answer: "LayerCover supports two main categories: **Stablecoins** (protection against de-peg events like USDC, DAI) and **Vault Shares** (protection for ERC-4626 yield-bearing vault positions). See [Buying Cover](/policyholders/buying-cover) for the full list of supported asset types."

## For Underwriters

<FAQAccordion faqs={[
  {
    question: "How do salvage rights work?",
    answer: "When a claim is paid, underwriters receive the 'distressed' assets that policyholders surrender. These are called salvage rights. If the assets later recover value (e.g., a protocol returns stolen funds), underwriters benefit from that recovery."
  },
  {
    question: "Are salvage rights tradeable?",
    answer: "Yes. Salvage rights are tokenized and can be traded on secondary markets. This lets underwriters exit frozen positions immediately by selling to distressed debt funds, rather than waiting for potential recovery."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a withdrawal notice period?",
    answer: "No. Syndicate withdrawals are instant for unlocked capital. Capital that is actively backing policies is locked until those policies expire or settle. The Backstop Pool may have its own withdrawal schedule."
  },
  {
    question: "How are losses distributed?",
    answer: "Losses are distributed pro-rata based on your share of the pool at the exact block of the claim event. You cannot avoid losses by withdrawing after an exploit - the protocol snapshots liability at the moment of the claim."
  },
  {
    question: "What returns can I expect?",
    answer: "Returns come from two sources: **Premiums** (your share of policy premiums paid by policyholders) and **Yield** (external DeFi yields from idle capital deployed to Aave/Compound). Actual APY varies by syndicate strategy, premium rates, and market conditions. See [Underwriting](/underwriters) for a detailed breakdown."
