</Callout>

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using the LayerCover protocol, website ([layercover.com](https://layercover.com)), documentation, SDK, or any associated smart contracts (collectively, the **"Services"**), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (**"Terms"**). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.

"**We**," "**us**," or "**LayerCover**" refers to LayerCover Labs Ltd and its affiliates. "**You**" or "**User**" refers to any individual or entity accessing the Services.

---

## 2. Eligibility

You represent and warrant that:

1. You are at least **18 years of age** (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction)
2. You have the **legal capacity** to enter into these Terms
3. You are **not located in**, incorporated in, or a citizen or resident of any **Restricted Territory** (see Section 10)
4. You are not subject to any **sanctions** administered by OFAC, the UN Security Council, the EU, or any other applicable governmental authority
5. Your use of the Services will not violate any applicable **law or regulation**

---

## 3. Description of Services

LayerCover is a **decentralised on-chain cover protocol** that facilitates:

- **Policyholders** purchasing cover for DeFi positions (stablecoin de-peg, vault share loss, parametric events)
- **Underwriters** providing capital through Syndicates to back risk pools and earn premiums and yield
- **Developers** integrating cover functionality into third-party applications via the LayerCover SDK

The Services provide a **user interface** and **developer tools** for interacting with smart contracts deployed on supported blockchain networks. LayerCover does not take custody of your funds, execute transactions on your behalf, or act as a counterparty to any cover arrangement.

---

## 4. Smart Contract Interactions

### 4.1 Self-Custody

All interactions with LayerCover smart contracts are **non-custodial**. You retain sole control of your wallet, private keys, and digital assets at all times. LayerCover cannot reverse, cancel, or modify any blockchain transaction once submitted.

### 4.2 Transaction Finality

Blockchain transactions are **irreversible** once confirmed. You are solely responsible for verifying transaction details (amounts, addresses, gas fees) before signing.

### 4.3 Smart Contract Risk

Smart contracts are experimental software. While LayerCover aims to conduct thorough [security audits](/resources/audits) and testing, **no smart contract can be guaranteed to be free of vulnerabilities**. You acknowledge and accept the inherent risks of interacting with smart contracts, including but not limited to:

- Undiscovered bugs or exploits
- Blockchain consensus failures or reorganisations
- Oracle malfunctions or manipulation
- Third-party protocol failures affecting integrated yield strategies

---

## 5. Cover Policies - Not Insurance

<Callout type="warning">
  **LayerCover cover policies are not insurance contracts.** They are on-chain financial instruments governed entirely by smart contract logic. LayerCover is not an insurance company, broker, or intermediary and does not provide insurance in any jurisdiction.
</Callout>

### 5.1 No Guarantee of Payout

Cover payouts are contingent on:

- Sufficient capital in the [Capital Pool](/protocol/capital-pool), [Backstop Pool](/protocol/backstop-pool), and any applicable reinsurance arrangements
- Satisfaction of all claim conditions as defined by the relevant smart contracts
- Proper claim submission within required timeframes

### 5.2 Partial Payouts

If the payout waterfall (pool capital → reinsurance → backstop → treasury) is exhausted before a claim is fully satisfied, the claim will be **partially paid**. LayerCover does not guarantee full coverage under all circumstances.

### 5.3 Cooldown Period

New policies are subject to a **7-day cooldown period** during which claims cannot be filed, as described in the [policy documentation](/policyholders/buying-cover).

---

## 6. Underwriter Risks

If you participate as an underwriter (providing capital via Syndicates), you acknowledge:

1. **Loss of Capital** - Your deposited capital may be used to pay claims. Losses are distributed pro-rata based on your share of the relevant pool
2. **Illiquidity** - Capital actively backing policies is locked until those policies expire or settle
3. **No Guaranteed Returns** - Past yields from premiums or DeFi strategies are not indicative of future performance
4. **Salvage Rights** - When claims are paid, underwriters receive distressed assets (salvage rights), which may have reduced or zero value

---

## 7. Fees

LayerCover may charge fees for certain Services, including but not limited to:

- **Claim fees** assessed on filed claims
- **Protocol fees** on premium flows
- **Referral commissions** as described in the [Referral System](/governance/referral-system)

Fee structures are encoded in smart contracts and may be adjusted through governance processes. Current fee parameters are documented on the [Parameters](/resources/parameters) page.

---

## 8. Prohibited Uses

You agree **not** to use the Services to:

1. Violate any applicable law, regulation, or sanctions programme
2. Engage in market manipulation, wash trading, or fraudulent claim activity
3. Exploit smart contract vulnerabilities for personal gain (rather than responsibly disclosing them)
4. Circumvent access controls, rate limits, or security mechanisms
5. Use automated systems (bots, scripts) in a manner that degrades the Services for other users
6. Infringe upon any intellectual property or proprietary rights

---

## 9. Intellectual Property
