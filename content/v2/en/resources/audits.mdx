<Callout type="warning">
  **LayerCover has not yet launched on mainnet.** All audits and programs below are planned milestones. This page will be updated with reports as they are completed.
</Callout>

LayerCover takes a defence-in-depth approach to security - formal audits, economic stress testing, a guarded launch, and a bug bounty program all work together to protect user funds.

## Guarded Mainnet Launch

To mitigate early-stage risk, LayerCover will execute a **staged mainnet rollout** (similar to EigenLayer):

| Safeguard | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deposit Caps** | Initial liquidity strictly limited via global TVL caps and per-pool maximums |
| **Progressive Expansion** | Caps raised incrementally via governance after stability milestones are met |
| **Monitoring** | Real-time on-chain monitoring with automated circuit breakers |

---

## Economic Risk Review

**Target: Q3–Q4 2026**

Before mainnet launch, we will commission third-party economic simulations (targeting partners like Gauntlet or Chaos Labs) to validate:

- Reserve ratios and solvency margins under stress
- Coverage limit calibration
- Fee and premium sensitivity to market volatility

## Bug Bounty Program

**Launch: Q4 2026**

LayerCover will launch a **$1,000,000** bug bounty program hosted on **Immunefi**.

| Detail | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Pool** | $1,000,000 |
| **Scope** | All production smart contracts, SDKs, APIs, and frontends |
| **Payouts** | Tiered based on severity (OWASP/Impact) |
| **Launch Event** | Time-bound competition with bonus multipliers for pre-launch discoveries |
