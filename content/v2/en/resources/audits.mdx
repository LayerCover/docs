LayerCover prioritizes security through a multi-layered approach combining formal audits, economic modeling, and a staged mainnet rollout.

## Guarded Mainnet Launch

To mitigate early-stage risk, LayerCover will execute a **staged mainnet rollout** (similar to EigenLayer).

* **Deposit Caps:** Initial liquidity will be strictly limited via global TVL caps and per-pool maximums.
* **Progressive Expansion:** Caps will be raised incrementally via governance only after stability milestones are met.
* **Objective:** This ensures the protocol scale matches its proven security maturity, preventing outsized losses during the hardening phase.

## Smart Contract Audits

We engage Tier-1 security firms to validate the protocol architecture and codebase.

| Timeline | Phase | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1 2026** | **Pre-Seed Audit** | Comprehensive architecture audit of the core suite (PolicyManager, RiskManager, CapitalPool, PoolRegistry). |
| **Q3 2026** | **Post-Seed Audits** | Two subsequent, independent re-audits of upgraded contracts, deployment scripts, and operational runbooks. |

## Economic Risk Review

**Target: Q3–Q4 2026**

Before mainnet launch, we will commission third-party economic simulations (targeting partners like Gauntlet or Chaos Labs). This ensures our reserve ratios, coverage limits, and fee calibrations can withstand market volatility and stress scenarios.

## Bug Bounty Program

**Launch: Q4 2026**

LayerCover will launch a **$1,000,000** bug bounty program hosted on **Immunefi**.

* **Scope:** All production smart contracts, SDKs, APIs, and frontends.
* **Payouts:** Tiered based on severity (OWASP/Impact).
* **Competition:** The program opens with a time-bound competition offering bonus multipliers and spotlight features for top-ranked pre-launch discoveries.
