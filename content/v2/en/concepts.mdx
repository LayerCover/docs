**LayerCover** is a decentralized, non-custodial risk marketplace that enables **programmable protection** for any crypto asset. By connecting capital providers directly with policyholders through autonomous underwriting pools, LayerCover eliminates the need for a traditional insurance carrier—removing friction, minimizing costs, and guaranteeing transparent, on-chain claims settlement.

<Callout type="info">
  **Key Takeaway:** LayerCover removes the insurance company from the equation. Instead, **smart contracts** coordinate potential losses (risk) with committed capital (underwriting), automating everything from premium collection to claims payout.
</Callout>

## How it Works

The protocol operates on a simple but powerful loop:

1. **Policyholders** purchase coverage as NFTs.
2. **Underwriters** deposit capital into pools to back these risks.
3. **Premiums** flow from policyholders to underwriters (and into a reward pool).
4. **Underwriter Capital** is deployed into DeFi yields (like Aave/Compound) to generate extra returns.
5. **Claims** are deterministic and paid out instantly from the capital pool.

## Competitive Landscape

LayerCover combines the professional syndicate model of Lloyd's of London with the trustless execution of DeFi, while eliminating the governance delays of mutual models.

| Feature | **LayerCover** | **Nexus Mutual** | **Lloyd's of London** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claim Settlement** | Instant, parametric | Governance vote (days/weeks) | Manual assessment (weeks/months) |
| **Pricing Model** | Fixed-rate orderbook | Utilisation curve | Broker-negotiated |
| **Capital Custody** | On-chain, non-custodial | On-chain, pooled | Off-chain, custodial |
| **Underwriter Control** | Per-pool allocation | Shared pool exposure | Syndicate-specific |
| **Salvage Rights** | Tradeable on-chain tokens | None | Complex legal process |
| **Reinsurance** | Protocol-native tranches | None (single pool) | External reinsurers |
| **Settlement Currency** | USDC (instant) | ETH/DAI (after vote) | Fiat (after legal process) |

## Oracle-Free Architecture

A defining characteristic of LayerCover is its minimisation of external dependencies. Core operations execute deterministically without relying on price feeds.

- **Deterministic Execution:** Policy management, premium accrual, and claim payouts are fully on-chain.
- **No Price Dependency:** The system settles claims using unit-based accounting. If a policy covers 100,000 USDC, the payout is calculated in USDC—no oracle valuation required.
- **Conflict Elimination:** This eliminates valuation disputes and removes the risk of front-running stale price updates during volatility.
