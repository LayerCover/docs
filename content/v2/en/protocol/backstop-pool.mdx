<Callout type="info">
  **TL;DR:** The Backstop Pool is a protocol-wide reserve funded by a percentage of all premiums. It steps in when a pool's primary capital is insufficient to pay claims.
</Callout>

## Why a Backstop?

Individual risk pools can be overwhelmed by catastrophic events. If a major protocol is exploited and claims exceed the pool's capital, policyholders need a fallback. The Backstop Pool provides that safety net - a shared reserve that backstops every pool in the protocol.

## Liquidity Waterfall

When a claim is filed, the PayoutManager follows a strict priority order:

    C["🚨 Claim Filed"] --> L1{"Pool Capital<br/>sufficient?"}
    L1 -->|Yes| P1["✅ Paid from Pool"]

| Layer | Source | Funded By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1** | Pool Capital (Idle + Adapters) | Underwriter deposits |
| **Layer 2** | 3rd Party Reinsurance | External reinsurers (quota-share hooks) |
| **Layer 3** | Backstop Pool | Percentage of all protocol premiums |
| **Layer 4** | Protocol Treasury | Protocol revenue, pre-approved token reserves |

<Callout type="warning">
  If all four layers are exhausted, the claim is **partially paid** - the claimant receives whatever was available. Losses are never socialized across uninvolved syndicates or underwriters.
</Callout>

## How the Backstop Pool Works

### Funding
Every premium paid across the entire protocol is split:
- **80%** → Pool underwriters (Syndicates)
- **20%** → Backstop Pool
- Protocol fees are taken separately

This means the Backstop grows proportionally with protocol usage - more policies sold = larger safety net.

### Managed by SharedAssetController
The Backstop Pool is managed by the **SharedAssetController**, which:
- Aggregates contributions from all pools
- Deploys idle backstop capital to yield strategies (Aave, Compound)
- Processes payout requests from the PayoutManager
- Maintains minimum reserve ratios

### Usage
When the PayoutManager determines that a pool's capital is insufficient:

1. It calculates the **deficit** (claim amount − available pool capital)
2. It requests the deficit from the Backstop Pool
3. The Backstop covers the gap up to its available balance
4. If the Backstop is also exhausted, a `BackstopDepleted` event is emitted and the Protocol Treasury is drawn from (if registered and pre-approved)
5. If all layers are exhausted, the claimant receives a partial payout for whatever was available

## Backstop Pool Economics

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Inflows
        P1["Pool 1 → 20%"]
        P2["Pool 2 → 20%"]
        P3["Pool 3 → 20%"]
        PN["Pool N → 20%"]
    end

    subgraph Backstop
        BP["Backstop Pool"]
        BP --> YA["Yield on idle capital"]
    end

    subgraph Outflows
        D["Deficit payouts"]
    end

    P1 --> BP
    P2 --> BP
    P3 --> BP
    PN --> BP
    YA --> BP
    BP --> D
```

The Backstop Pool benefits from **diversification** - it pools premium contributions from every coverage category (stablecoin, vault, parametric). A major event in one category is backstopped by premiums from all others.
