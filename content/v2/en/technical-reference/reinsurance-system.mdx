description: Technical reference for the Reinsurance (Backstop) system.
---

The **Reinsurance System** (also known as the Backstop) provides a shared layer of protection for all Syndicates in the protocol. It acts as a "catastrophe pool" that absorbs losses when individual Syndicates are exhausted.

## Overview

The core component is the **SharedAssetController**, which manages a pool of capital (USDC) contributed by reinsurance providers.

### Key Responsibilities
1.  **Catastrophe Protection:** Covers claims that exceed a Syndicate's capacity.
2.  **Capital Efficiency:** Pools risk across the entire protocol, reducing the capital requirements for individual Syndicates.
3.  **Tranche Management:** Organizes capital into priority tranches (Junior/Senior) to offer different risk/reward profiles to LPs.

## Architecture

### **SharedAssetController.sol**

This contract replaces the legacy **BackstopPool**. It is the central vault for reinsurance capital.

### Tranche System

Capital in the Reinsurance System is organized into **Tranches**. For a detailed explanation of how Junior and Senior tranches function, please refer to the [Core Concepts: Capital Waterfall Tranches](/concepts/reinsurance#the-capital-waterfall-tranches) guide.

### Liquidity Waterfall Integration

The Reinsurance System is Step 2 in the [Payout System](/technical-reference/payout-system) waterfall:

1.  Syndicate Adapters
2.  **Reinsurance System** (This system)
3.  Idle Cash
4.  aTokens

When called upon, the **SharedAssetController** draws liquidity from its tranches in **reverse priority order** (Junior first).

## Core Concepts

### 1. Dual Yield
Like Syndicates, the Reinsurance System supports **Dual Yield**:
*   **Premiums:** A portion of every policy premium sold by *any* Syndicate is routed to the Reinsurance System.
*   **Base Yield:** Idle capital is deployed to external yield strategies (e.g., Aave) via an **IYieldAdapter**.

### 2. Emergency aToken Transfer
In extreme market conditions where underlying liquidity is frozen, the Reinsurance System can transfer its strategy tokens (aTokens) directly to claimants to settle obligations.

## Integration Details

### Drawing Liquidity

Only the **CapitalPool** or **RiskManager** can trigger a draw.

```solidity
function drawFund(uint256 amountToDraw) external;
```

### Adding a Tranche

New tranches are registered by the protocol governance.

```solidity
function addTranche(address vault, uint8 priority) external onlyOwner;
```
